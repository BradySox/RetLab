"""Campaign plugin preseeds: features that depend on a plugin runtime must ship it.

A player whose saved defaults disabled a plugin would otherwise silently lose every
feature that emits into it: the emitter emits, nothing consumes. A campaign preseeds
the plugin ON through its ``settings.plugins`` block, which the New Game wizard layers
OVER the player's saved defaults (see ``QNewGameSettings._load_campaign_settings``).
Red Tide's Skynet preseed is the worked case.
