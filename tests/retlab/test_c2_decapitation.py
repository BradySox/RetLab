"""Command-center decapitation -> degraded enemy planning (§52, Features A1+A2).

Locks the coupling: a side's dead command centers scale its planner
unpredictability up (0 when off / intact), the health fraction is exact, the SITREP
status line reads the enemy network, and a C2-less campaign is a no-op. A2 locks
the offensive package-count throttle: the cap shrinks with C2 health (floored,
None when off/intact), and the HTN root stops offering the offensive middle once
the side's planned offensive packages reach it -- reactive prefix and recovery
tail are never throttled.
