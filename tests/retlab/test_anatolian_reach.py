"""Syria - Anatolian Reach laydown guards.

Israel + a US carrier and tanker hub against a Turkey-Russia bloc in 2004. The
campaign's whole shape is a 250-400 nm penetration, and three of its decisions
are load-bearing in ways nothing else in the tree would catch:

* **Akrotiri is support-only.** It is the closest blue base to seven of the nine
  Turkish fields (Incirlik 188 nm against Ramat David's 260), so a single strike
  or fighter squadron based there wins every auto-planner comparison and the
  Israeli squadrons stop flying. The long-range campaign then quietly stops
  happening with nothing in the log to say why. Verified in the first flown turn:
  Akrotiri put up one E-3A and two KC-135s and no combat aircraft.
* **The enemy faction is inline, not a name.** Retribution allows one faction per
  coalition, so the alliance is written into the yaml (the shape Fuzzle's shipped
  Operation Allied Sword uses). If it silently degrades to a named faction the
  Russian half -- and with it every long-range SAM -- disappears, because
  Turkey 2005 rosters no LORAD at all.
* **The SAM belt is period-gated by hand.** ``restrict_weapons_by_date`` gates
  weapons but never preset groups, so nothing except this test stops an S-400
  (2007) or a Buk-M2 (2008) being added to a 2004 campaign.

Validated at ``load_theater`` depth, the fork's campaign-test convention.
