"""Red Tide stands its three rear S-300 hubs up as regiments (SAM-belt STANDARD).

Sperenberg, Kastrup and Schoenefeld each field THREE clustered long-range (S-300)
fire units plus a shared EWR, so range-mode advanced-IADS nets them into a
regiment that degrades gracefully under SEAD instead of dying to one HARM/one
turn (the CLAUDE.md "SAM belts: strategic -> regiment-by-authoring" standard,
applied to Red Tide 2026-07-12 under the user's feature-lock override).

Marker-level lock (mirrors test_red_tide_motorpool): a future red_tide.miz
re-save that drops the clustered battalions or the hub EWRs fails here. The
end-to-end assignment (each hub CP gets 3 long_range_sams preset locations) was
headless-verified through Campaign.load_theater at build time.
