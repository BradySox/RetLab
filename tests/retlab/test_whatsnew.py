"""The What's New feed (§92) must load, order, and degrade safely.

The window it backs is reachable with no game open, so the load path is held to
"never raises": a missing, unreadable, or half-written data file costs an empty
window and nothing else. The ordering test pins the property the file's whole
existence rests on -- the changelog cannot answer "what changed lately" because
it is grouped by area, so the feed is ordered by date. One file per entry is what
keeps two pull requests from colliding in it.
