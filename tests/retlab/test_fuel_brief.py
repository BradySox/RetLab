"""Tests for the in-app fuel-plan readout (§46 UI surfacing).

The brief must tell the same story as the kneeboard ladder and the tanker
decision: same per-leg walk, tanker top-offs applied at REFUEL waypoints, the
walk ends at the landing point (divert/bullseye reference waypoints are not
flown legs), and external fuel counts the tanks on the loadout shown.
