"""Carrier deck spawn policy + MP slot timing (feature §64).

DCS offers no mission-level control over deck parking beyond spawn timing: the
mission-start spawn wave fills the six-pack (which sits in the taxi lane to the
bow catapults) first, and a group activated even one second later is placed
elsewhere on deck (dcs_liberation#1309). These tests pin the generator's use of
that lever:

* AI carrier ground starts always spawn >= 1s late (never in the six-pack).
* Player carrier flights never take it: in multiplayer a late-activated client
  group is a "delayed start" slot nobody can fly (test 54, 2026-10-07), so they
  spawn at mission start like airfield player flights.
* A TOT-delayed player carrier flight spawns uncontrolled at mission start like
  its airfield counterpart, and the StartCommand holds the AI members to the
  planned push.
* Single player ignores "Spawn player flights immediately": with fewer than
  two player slots in the mission (the same predicate that assigns Player
  rather than Client skill) there is no slot list to keep selectable, so the
  lone player flight is delayed to its planned start time — and a delayed
  cold player flight late-activates (materializing at its planned startup
  time) instead of sitting uncontrolled in the pit from mission start.
