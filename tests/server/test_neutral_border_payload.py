"""§98: the neutral-border map payload the planning UI draws.

The border is authored in terrain XY and drawn by Leaflet in lat/lng, so the
conversion is the thing worth pinning: a silently wrong transform puts a
44-vertex ring somewhere plausible-looking and nobody notices until a player
routes around empty sky. The Lebanon fixture's real bounding box is the oracle.
