"""AGENTS.md is a byte-identical mirror of CLAUDE.md below the title line.

The two files are the same 12,000-word guide addressed to two different agent
harnesses. Keeping them in step is a documented manual ritual -- `cp CLAUDE.md
AGENTS.md`, then edit line 1 back -- performed on 385 commits so far with nothing
checking it. A missed sync silently leaves one harness reading stale rules, which
is exactly the failure the guide exists to prevent.

This is the check. It does not remove the ritual; it removes the chance of
forgetting it.
