"""The pilot career logbook (§96): the ledger between §91 and the pilot roster.

Two things are pinned here because getting either wrong makes the feature worse
than not having it:

* Only records that actually FLEW are folded. §91 emits a counters-only entry
  for every AI wingman that was never position-sampled, and a track-but-no-
  movement entry for the untasked airframes parked on the ramp. Folding either
  inflates a career's sortie count by the group size.
* A rank grade whose requirement names a field that does not exist is REJECTED,
  not dropped -- a dropped requirement is met by everyone on their first sortie.
