"""Radio band integrity for airframes whose radios cannot reach the UHF band.

Retribution allocates every inter-flight frequency -- departure ATC, AWACS,
JTAC, the package frequency, tankers, divert ATC -- out of a hardcoded 225-400
MHz UHF band (``RadioRegistry.alloc_uhf``), and allocates a player-crewed
flight's intra-flight channel from the airframe's own ``intra_flight`` radio
(``AircraftType.alloc_flight_radio``). Both assume the aircraft can actually
tune what it is handed. Most modern jets carry a UHF set, so this holds; a
handful of airframes do not, and each needs its data to say so honestly.

The established engine convention for a narrow-band airframe is to route
presets to a radio that can tune them, or -- where none can -- to decline the
assignment entirely. ``FarmerRadioChannelAllocator`` states it outright: "The
Farmer only has 6 preset channels. It also only has a VHF radio, and currently
our ATC data and AWACS are only in the UHF band." ``SCR522RadioChannelAllocator``
and ``ARC5RadioChannelAllocator`` likewise assign intra-flight plus ATC and
deliberately never assign the package frequency.

These tests pin the two airframes that were getting it wrong. Assertions are on
*bands* and *radio indices*, never on radio display names -- any entry covering
the right band is correct.
