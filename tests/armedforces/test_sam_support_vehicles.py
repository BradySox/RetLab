"""SAM batteries field their support section: cargo trucks, fuel bowsers, power.

Background (2026-08-04). A textbook SA-10 site is not just radars and launchers --
it carries a refuelling section and the 5I57A diesel power stations that run the
battery. Retribution modelled none of it, for three compounding reasons:

1. No refueller had a unit yaml at all, so `ATZ-10` and friends were never
   `GroundUnitType`s, never in `Faction.accessible_units`, and therefore always
   rejected by `Faction.has_access_to_dcs_type`. They existed only in
   `tgogenerator`'s hardcoded FARP/airfield ground-support pool, which bypasses
   the unit registry -- which is why an ATZ-10 only ever appeared on a ramp.
2. No faction listed one.
3. The S-300 family's `S-300 Site Logistics` slot was DEAD CONFIG: declared in
   the layout yaml with no matching group in the shared `S-300_Site.miz`.

That third point is the dangerous one and it is what `test_no_layout_declares_a_dead_slot`
guards. `LayoutLoader._load_from_miz` walks the groups in the MIZ and looks each
one up in the mapping; a slot named in the yaml that matches no MIZ group is
never instantiated and is silently ignored -- no warning, no error. The same bug
had also quietly disabled the Sky Sabre battery's point defence, whose slot was
named "Point Defense" against a MIZ group called "PD".
