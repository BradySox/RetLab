"""Recon intel-fog: enemy site composition/rings hidden until discovered.

Covers the discovery gate (``known_for``), the omniscient/setting escape hatches,
and the save-migration default. What actually trips the gate -- a strike or an
offensive overflight, never recon -- is asserted in ``test_recon_reveal_rule.py``
where the mission-results fixtures already live.
