"""The ingress point must respect the package's own weapon range.

The attack task does not activate until a flight reaches the ingress point, and
the doctrine bound is weapon-agnostic (45 nm on modern doctrine). A package
carrying a 160 nm anti-ship missile therefore flew PAST its own launch range,
into the target's defenses, and was shot down or turned back before it ever
fired -- the "flew straight in and never launched" case documented in
juanjux/dcs-retribution's OPFOR playbook.

The number is a planning bound, not a promise: DCS releases at its own doctrine
distance regardless. What it buys is that the flight is not dragged inside the
defenses before its attack task exists.
