"""Civilian background-traffic planning (Python side).

The civilian layer is planned in ``game/missiongenerator/civiliantraffic.py`` and
spawned via pydcs (no MOOSE RAT -- see that module's header for why RAT stays
retired). The geometry is plain Python, so unlike the old RAT plugin it is exercised
here.

Rebuilt 2026-08-05 against the DM's two named issues, and these tests are shaped to
pin exactly those:

* **airways, not milk runs** -- a fixed-wing route is now ONE long transit, not a
  chain of five short rear-area hops;
* **civil identity is a data table** -- fleet, operators and cruise levels are chosen
  per region, and 1944 theatres field no civil traffic at all.
