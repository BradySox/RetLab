## Airfield elevations for kneeboard QFE — `dcs_airfield_elevations.py`

The kneeboard QFE is reduced from QNH using each field's elevation. Those
elevations live in `resources/airport_imagery/<terrain>.json`. They were
originally SRTM/OSM estimates (see `derive_airport_imagery_offsets.py`), which can
be off by tens of metres versus DCS's own terrain mesh — enough to leave the
altimeter 50–75 ft off when you dial QFE. This tool replaces them with DCS's exact
`land.getHeight`, so kneeboard QFE matches the in-sim ATIS.

It's a per-terrain workflow you run for maps you own:

```bash
# 1. build a probe mission for the terrain (valid names below)
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python scripts/dcs_airfield_elevations.py generate --terrain Syria
#    -> writes atmos_probe_syria.miz

# 2. load atmos_probe_syria.miz in DCS, let it sit a few seconds, quit.
#    The probe logs each airfield's land.getHeight to dcs.log (Saved Games/DCS/Logs/dcs.log)
#    and, if io is available, writes atmos_probe.json (path printed in the [ATMOS] log line).

# 3. preview the change table, then apply it in place (terrain auto-detected from the dump)
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python scripts/dcs_airfield_elevations.py apply --log <dcs.log> --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python scripts/dcs_airfield_elevations.py apply --log <dcs.log>
```

`apply` reads from `--log <dcs.log>` (reassembles the dump the probe streamed to
the log — works even when DCS sanitizes `io`) or `--dump atmos_probe.json` (the
file the probe writes when `MissionScripting.lua` is de-sanitized). It updates only
`elevation_m` + `elevation_source` per airfield, preserving runway/imagery fields,
and adds an elevation-only stub for any airfield missing from the JSON.

**Valid `--terrain` names:** Afghanistan, Caucasus, Falklands, GermanyColdWar,
Iraq, Kola, MarianaIslands, Nevada, Normandy, PersianGulf, Sinai, Syria, TheChannel.

Implementation: the probe Lua is `resources/plugins/base/dcs_atmos_probe.lua`; the
dump parser is `game/atmosprobe/model.py`; tests live under `tests/atmosprobe/`.

> Note: a de-sanitized `MissionScripting.lua` (the copy Retribution ships at
> `resources/scripts/MissionScripting.lua`) is what lets `io` write a file; without
> it the probe falls back to the dcs.log stream, which `apply --log` consumes.

## Terrain heights for DTC steerpoints — `dcs_terrain_heights.py`

A data cartridge replaces the jet's route, so it must give every target
steerpoint an elevation above sea level. Without a grid that is the nearest
airfield's elevation, which is wrong in hills. This samples DCS's own
`land.getHeight` on a 1 km grid per terrain:

```bash
# 1. build the probe mission (same terrain names as above)
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python scripts/dcs_terrain_heights.py generate --terrain Syria
# 2. run terrain_height_probe_syria.miz in DCS, unpause, wait for "[HEIGHTS] done"
#    (it writes Saved Games/DCS/Logs/retlab_terrain_heights_Syria.txt), then quit
# 3. write resources/terrain_heights/syria.npz
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python scripts/dcs_terrain_heights.py apply "<Saved Games>/DCS/Logs/retlab_terrain_heights_Syria.txt"
```

Needs Retribution's de-sanitized `MissionScripting.lua` (the probe writes a file).
`--step` and `--margin-km` change the grid spacing and how far past the outermost
airfields it reaches.

## Other scripts

- **`derive_airport_imagery_offsets.py`** — generates the
  `resources/airport_imagery/<terrain>.json` files from OpenStreetMap (runway
  geometry + the imagery offset) and Open-Elevation/SRTM (the initial elevations
  that `dcs_airfield_elevations.py` then upgrades). Part of the kneeboard recon
  feature.
- **`gen_recon_kneeboards.py`** — renders the recon kneeboard pages (basemap tiles
  + overlays). Part of the kneeboard recon feature.
- **`build-client.ps1`** (PowerShell) — rebuilds the web-map client bundle
  (`client/build`) that the desktop app serves. Run it after pulling client/UI changes
  into a **source** checkout, then restart Retribution — otherwise React changes (the map
  ribbon, layers panel, etc.) stay invisible because `client/build` is a prebuilt bundle.
  Runs `npm ci` automatically on a fresh checkout (or force it with `-Install`). The
  rolling `latest` release ZIP is already built this way by CI (`.github/actions/build-app`),
  so this is only for running from source.
