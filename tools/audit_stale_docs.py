"""Find published docs that still describe a removed feature.

``CLAUDE.md`` step 7: when a feature's RULE changes, the feature's own doc faces are
not enough -- every *other* note that merely mentions it is now wrong too, and those
are what get missed. The 2026-08-18 §3 rework updated 16 files and left 8 stale
claims, two of them on the published wiki. The 2026-08-07 CSAR replacement updated
the design note and left **five** published pages briefing a package that no longer
existed, including a sidebar-linked wiki page written in the present tense.

That step is a manual grep nobody runs. This makes it a command.

Scope is the **published** surface only -- ``README.md``, ``docs/wiki/`` and the
release-notes body inside ``.github/workflows/retlab-latest.yml``. Design notes
under ``docs/dev/`` are deliberately excluded: they are a historical record and
are *expected* to describe dead features.

A file whose opening carries a removal banner (see ``BANNERS``) is exempt, so a
page deliberately kept as a historical record does not trip the audit. No such
page exists right now -- the 2026-08-20 trim deleted both of them, on the view
that a published wiki should not carry tombstones at all.

    python tools/audit_stale_docs.py            # report; exit 1 if anything is found
    python tools/audit_stale_docs.py --quiet    # exit status only, for a CI gate

Exit 1 means a published doc is stale. Exit 2 means a row in the table below is
itself broken and has been checking nothing.

**Adding a feature when you remove one.** Append a :class:`Removed` row carrying the
terms that only make sense if the feature is *live*. Prefer a distinctive setting
name, class name or role name over a generic English word -- a broad pattern buries
the real hit in false positives, which is how the rule stopped being run by hand.
The first draft matched a bare "suspected activity" for §79 and flagged the COMINT
and COIN circles, which are both still real. Anything the audit should tolerate goes
in ``allow``: a substring that, when present on the matched line, means the mention
is a correct statement that the feature is gone.
