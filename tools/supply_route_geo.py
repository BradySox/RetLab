"""Author campaign ``supply_routes:`` that follow real driveable corridors.

**The standard (2026-07-03, user directive):** a drawn supply line must trace the
corridor you would actually *drive* between the two points -- the road, the river
valley, the mountain pass -- never a straight line across a ridgeline. The endpoints
stay on the control points (Retribution's ``add_yaml_supply_routes`` binds a route to
its CPs by the **first and last** waypoint only, so intermediates never change which
bases the route connects -- they are purely the corridor shape the convoy drives and
the line the player sees).

DCS's own road graph (``terrain.city_graph``) ships empty in the release pydcs, so we
cannot A* the roads programmatically here. But every modern DCS map is
**real-world-coordinate**, so the faithful method is to trace the real road network by
its real latitude/longitude and convert each junction to terrain XY -- the drawn line
then lands on the actual roads/valleys of the satellite base layer. Calibration on
Afghanistan: real town lat/lons convert to within ~1-5 km of the hand-placed FOB
markers, so this is accurate to well inside a route's width.

Usage: define a terrain + a list of :class:`Route` (endpoints as exact CP/marker XY,
intermediate corridor points as real ``(lat, lon)``) and run to emit the YAML block.
Each campaign's routes are defined below as its reference application; pick one by name
and paste the output into that campaign's ``resources/campaigns/*.yaml``.
