"""Author campaign ``neutral_border_defense:`` borders from real boundary data (§98).

**The standard (2026-08-24, DM call):** a neutral country's border polygon comes
from real boundary data, never hand-tracing -- and only real-world-georeferenced
maps get the feature (fictional-overlay campaigns are out of scope). Pipeline:
a public-domain country GeoJSON -> clip to the map area -> optional corridor cut
-> shapely simplify to a vertex budget -> ``Point.from_latlng`` -> terrain XY ->
the yaml block pasted into ``resources/campaigns/*.yaml``. The GeoJSON is a
dev-time input read from disk; nothing here runs at campaign or mission time.

Three things matter beyond the basic trace:

**Clip to the map.** A country's real outline is mostly off any given DCS map --
Iran's runs to the Persian Gulf, hundreds of km outside Afghanistan's terrain.
Un-clipped, the vertex budget is spent on coastline nobody can fly to. Always
pass ``--clip``.

**Cut the corridor.** ``--corridor-lon`` subtracts a north-south lane, which
turns one country into the two walls of a flight corridor. This is how the
Afghanistan campaign models the OEF "boulevard": carrier aircraft coming north
out of the Arabian Sea have a lane through Pakistan and get intercepted if they
wander out of it. Each surviving piece is emitted as its own zone.

**Spawn point vs airfield.** ``--airfield`` for a neutral whose airbase is on
the map. ``--auto-spawn`` for one whose is not (every Afghanistan neighbour):
each piece gets an air-spawn point at its own representative point, guaranteed
inside that piece's territory.

Usage:

    # Lebanon: it has a field on the Syria map.
    python tools/neutral_border_geo.py lebanon.json --terrain syria \\
        --country Lebanon --airfield Rayak --sam

    # Pakistan: no field on the Afghanistan map, and a corridor cut for the
    # carrier route north.
    python tools/neutral_border_geo.py pakistan.json --terrain afghanistan \\
        --country Pakistan --auto-spawn \\
        --clip 24 36.5 60 72 --corridor-lon 64.3 66.3

GeoJSON coordinates are [lon, lat]; DCS terrain XY is pydcs Point.x/.y = DCS
x/z. Rings are simplified with growing tolerance until they fit the budget --
a border trigger needs corridor fidelity, not meters.
