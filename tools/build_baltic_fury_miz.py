"""Build resources/campaigns/operation_baltic_fury.miz from red_tide.miz.

Reshapes the all-vanilla Red Tide GermanyCW miz into the Operation Baltic Fury
laydown (docs/dev/design/retlab-baltic-fury-campaign-notes.md):

- Airport ownership flipped to the Baltic-approaches geometry: BLUE holds the
  German Bight corner (Nordholz, Bremen, Hamburg), RED holds the NE arc up to
  Copenhagen (Kastrup, Laage/Rostock, Peenemünde, Parchim, Wismar,
  Szczecin-Goleniów, Bornholm + the coastal-spine objectives Lübeck & Barth).
- A US CVN steams in the German Bight (blue ship group -> carrier control point,
  named to match the campaign yaml's carrier air-wing key + the §65 comms card).
- The signature IADS belt: coastal anti-ship wall (Bastion/Bal), strategic S-400
  regiments (single-radar battalions + shared EWR), a forward MERAD screen, point
  defense per base, an EWR net, the Baltic Fleet SAG, per-base advanced-IADS C2
  cells, blue/red economy, and a coastal SS-26 (§49 SCUD hunt).

Band-marker convention (game/campaignloader/mizcampaignloader.py): placed SAM/
EWR/ship/coastal/missile groups are BAND MARKERS read by position + unit class;
the FACTION supplies the real mod (CH/HDS) units at generation. Every marker here
is a VANILLA DCS unit (the exact marker types the loader keys on), so the miz
round-trips through pydcs losslessly (mod units would corrupt the save).

⚠️ THIS WAS A ONE-TIME BOOTSTRAP. The DM built the laydown out in the Mission Editor
on 2026-07-20, so `operation_baltic_fury.miz` -- NOT the tables below -- is now the
source of truth, and `main()` REFUSES to run when the miz exists unless you pass
--force. (This docstring used to claim the opposite; corrected 2026-08-02.)

--force no longer reproduces the original bootstrap either: it rebuilds from
`red_tide.miz`, which has moved on since (road-snapped supply routes + a Haina ammo
depot, 2026-08-02). If the laydown ever needs regenerating, convert to the
Enduring/Inherent Resolve decorate-a-base pattern first -- commit the hand-authored
miz as `operation_baltic_fury_base.miz` and reduce this tool to an additive pass over
it (see tools/build_iraq_inherent_resolve_miz.py for the reference implementation).

Usage: python tools/build_baltic_fury_miz.py   (refuses unless --force)
