"""Build a terrain's shipped §98 border file (``resources/borders/<terrain>.yaml``).

Borders are a property of the map, not of a campaign, so they are generated once
per terrain and every campaign on that map gets them. This is what makes §98
reach the 52 real-world-map campaigns that author no borders at all.

The file carries **geometry and an origin, nothing else**. Posture and airframe
come from the dated table at mission-generation time, so one border file is
correct in 1975 and in 2025.

Per country the tool: clips the real boundary to the map, drops sliver pieces,
simplifies to a vertex budget, converts to terrain XY, and picks an origin --
a real map airfield inside the polygon where one exists, otherwise an air-spawn
station at the polygon's representative point.

**Every country on the map is drawn, the map's own nation included.** An
earlier ``--host`` flag left it out on the theory that a border round the
battlefield is noise. That deleted Russia from Kola and Iran from the Persian
Gulf -- the most relevant border on each of those maps -- and left the war
itself as the one region with no line on it. What a country's airspace *means*
is decided at run time from who holds the control points inside it, so the
tool has no business deciding which countries are interesting.

Usage:

    python tools/build_terrain_borders.py afghanistan \\
        --geojson-dir <dir> \\
        --countries Afghanistan Pakistan Iran Turkmenistan Uzbekistan \\
                    Tajikistan India \\
        --clip 24 38 59.5 73

Country land shares per map -- and which ones the eyeball misses -- are measured
in ``docs/dev/design/retlab-national-postures-notes.md``. Use that table for the
``--countries`` list; it caught India on Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia on Syria.

    country that only clips the map's edge, whose polygon middle is then off the
    map entirely: measured 2026-08-27, Caucasus put Turkey's station 170 km from
    the nearest modelled land, in neither the landmap's inclusion nor its sea
    zones -- the same signature as a point in the Caspian, well off that terrain.

    This line used to assert "a clip box is bigger than its terrain". It was not:
    measured 2026-09-10, SEVEN of the eight boxes stopped inside their own map,
    leaving 1,273,689 km2 of modelled land with no border drawn on it.

    **The landmap is NOT the map's extent, and neither is terrain.bounds.** Both
    say the Afghanistan map stops at 28.9N; Enduring Resolve's own carrier sits
    at 24.5N, and the F10 map draws ground to the coast below it. A pass that
    dropped pieces with "no modelled land inside" was written against that wrong
    premise and removed the same day -- it cut Turkey off the Caucasus map and
    Iran off the Iraq map. The clip box is the only authority on what is drawn,
    so derive it from what campaigns actually PLACE, not from either of those.

    Turkey is the case that matters, because it is the only one of the four with
    an airframe in any era; Armenia and Azerbaijan scramble nothing whatever
    their station says. The Lua normally launches 25 NM from the intruder rather
    than from the station, so this only bit through the documented concave
    fallback -- but that fallback exists precisely for awkward geometry, which
    is what a clipped border is.
