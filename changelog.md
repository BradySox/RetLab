# Retribution v1.6.3 (RetLab)

## Features/Improvements
* **[Mission Generation]** **The carrier deck cap and the Tomcat spawn delay are removed.** Every carrier flight parks on the deck again, and Tomcats spawn with the rest of the deck. A boat fragged past what its deck holds can lose flights to DCS again, as it did before the cap. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A wing flying both boom and probe aircraft gets one tanker of each, not two of the same.** The planner is meant to put up one theatre tanker per refuelling method, and on a Syria turn it put up **two boom KC-135s and no probe tanker** — the KC-135 MPRS sat untasked while the probe-fitted Mirages had nothing to tank from. The first tanker was left free to take the best squadron available, which happened to be the boom one, and the second was then asked for boom again. Each tanker is now tied to one method, the first included, and a method only counts if a land tanker that can actually reach the station dispenses it — so a probe tanker that exists but cannot get there never costs you the boom one. A wing with only a boom tanker still gets it, and a wing short of tankers still buys one. Takes effect on the next planned turn.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The land AWACS no longer orbits on top of the carrier.** The planner picks one AEW&C station per carrier plus one over land, and when every friendly airfield sat inside the enemy threat zone the "land" pick fell back to one that never checked whether it was land. On one Syria turn it chose **the amphibious ship parked 3.3 NM from the carrier**, so the carrier's single E-2C squadron flew **two racetracks 15 NM apart**, stacked beside the carrier's own tanker — while Incirlik, with an E-3A sitting untasked, was skipped. The land station is now always an airfield; when every field is threatened the least-exposed one that actually hosts the aircraft is used rather than none; and the same station can no longer be planned twice. The land tanker station on that turn moves too, from a field with no tanker to the one with the KC-135s. **A second AWACS fragged onto a station now sits 20 NM further from the threat** instead of stacking on the first; the first stays where it is. The same step for a second tanker used to move it back *toward* the threat when its field sat inside the zone, and now moves it away. The front-line orbit placement removed in August stays removed. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **An escort whose striker never flew used to orbit enemy territory until the mission ended.** Escorts are released by a flag the flight they are escorting raises at its split point. If that flight never gets there — wedged on a carrier deck, never spawned, shot down on the ingress — nothing raises the flag and the escort holds its anchor forever. On the same Syria turn **five escorts were still circling at mission end, four of them 168–310 km inside enemy airspace**. A release now fires on time regardless: the striker's own signal is still the normal path, with a timed backstop under it. Players leading a package are unaffected — they already had this. Nothing to configure.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The Viper's bullseye steerpoint is the bullseye again.** Steerpoint 25 is the F-16C's bullseye, set from the mission when it loads, and the data cartridge was writing a tanker or AWACS orbit over it — so the DED read one place and the kneeboard read another. On one Syria turn steerpoint 25 held the AWACS orbit while the card read Aleppo, 200 km away. The cartridge now stops at 24 and leaves 25 to the jet. **The trade:** a flight with a full 20-waypoint route gets four support anchors instead of five, so the farthest one is dropped. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The tanker and AWACS boxes on the F10 map are as wide as the turn the aircraft flies.** The racetrack was drawn 2 nm either side of the leg, which is narrower than the turn a tanker makes at the ends, so the aircraft spent **about half its time on station outside its own box** — two KC-135s ran 17.7 and 19.0 km off the leg, an E-3A 13.8 and an E-2C 8.9. The box is now sized from that flight's own orbit speed, so a fast tanker gets a wide one and a Hawkeye a narrow one, never below the old 2 nm. Combat air patrol stations keep the thin marker: a CAP chases contacts and no box can contain it. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A flight only gets a tanker leg when it needs the gas.** The refuel waypoint was planned whenever the coalition owned a tanker anywhere in theatre, without ever asking whether the flight could get home without one. On one Syria turn a **B-1B that had burned 11% of its fuel flew 66 km past its own field** to reach a tanker, arrived with 89% remaining, and was still out there when the mission ended. The waypoint is now dropped when the planned sortie lands with fuel to spare — measured against the airframe's own landing reserve, and measured **without** counting any top-off, so a flight that clears the bar never needed the tanker. **Every airframe, not just the bombers.** An airframe with no measured fuel data has to clear a wider margin, and one with no fuel model at all keeps its tanker, so nothing is dropped on a guess. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Fork]** **The fork is renamed from 414Ret to RetLab and is no longer squadron-branded.** It is a development fork of DCS Retribution, not a replacement for it. What you will notice: the release asset is **`retlab-latest.zip`** instead of `414th-retribution-latest.zip` (the download page URL is unchanged), the settings page is **RetLab Features**, and the planner switch reads **RetLab suite**. Three squadrons are gone -- **414th JFG Hornets**, **414th Voodoo Squadron** and **414th Aviation Detachment** -- because each pinned a livery that only existed in the squadron's own Saved Games, so they were already broken for anyone else. Red Tide's three slots now fly **23rd FS**, **VMFA-251** and **HMLA-269 (UH-1H)**, which match the same aircraft and tasks. The real **414th Tactical Fighter Squadron** stays, without its private livery pin, and the 512th, 526th and 480th TFS are unchanged. Authored ground-group names inside the Red Tide and Desert Storm mission files lose the `414th ` prefix. **Existing saves load**: the `game/fourteenth` package is now `game/retlab`, and because a save stores the module path, the loader remaps the old one. Nothing to convert and nothing to configure.
* **[Campaign]** **A ground object on an airfield's runway strip or apron is named at New Game.** DCS holds every AI fixed-wing taxi at a field that has a ground unit on its taxiways; on Long Road to H3 the campaign's own Incirlik EWR marker sat 265 m off the runway centreline on the south-west taxiway and nothing launched until it was moved by hand. Generation now checks every ground object against each field's runway band (300 m either side, 1.6 km along) and its stands (80 m) and logs a warning naming the group, the field and the offsets. Warn only; nothing is moved. In the Long Road to H3 campaign file the Incirlik EWR marker is deleted and the Al Qusayr armor and Gaziantep EWR markers are moved 700–860 m off their taxiways. NEW game required for the campaign fix.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Airbase harassment is removed.** The Vietnam Ops standoff rocket/mortar barrage on forward fields, and the frontline artillery mode that reused it, are gone. A scripted explosion on an airfield puts it into DCS's under-attack state and every AI fixed-wing launch there is then held on the ramp; with a barrage every four minutes the hold never cleared, so on one Yankee Station turn the Ubon and Da Nang wings sat for the whole mission after the first ten minutes, and the same happened at Damascus, Batumi and Anapa on earlier turns. The two settings and the plugin's harassment options no longer exist; campaigns that preseeded them (Yankee Station, Velvet Thunder, Red Flag 81-2, Enduring Resolve, Inherent Resolve, Red Tide, Baltic Fury) simply lose the barrage. The COIN campaigns' insurgent mortar fire on FOBs is a separate feature and stays.
* **[Campaign]** **Helicopters are no longer sent on Armed Recon.** Any airframe with a CAS or BAI role was also given Armed Recon, and Armed Recon targets bases and supply corridors across the whole theatre, so a transport Huey was being fragged to hunt a FOB two hours away at 200 ft, and a Mi-8 to sweep an enemy airfield. Helicopters keep CAS and BAI at the front; Armed Recon is fast movers only unless a helicopter's own data authors it. Applies to both sides on the next planned turn.
* **[Campaign]** **1968 Yankee Station: the blue air wing is halved.** 116 blue airframes put 31 blue packages into a 60-minute turn and the campaign was unplayable. Blue is now 61: one E-2 and one tanker shared between the two carriers, one Arc Light B-52 cell instead of two, a 4-jet Alpha Strike squadron, single photo birds, no Saigon fighter squadron or KC-130, and every attack squadron at a pair or two. Red is untouched. NEW game required.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A pilot who ejects during the mission keys the briefed 260 kHz too.** The kneeboard has always briefed one survivor beacon channel, and survivors already down at mission start keyed it, but a pilot who went down during the mission was registered by MOOSE's own path and got a random channel from its pool (620 and 820 kHz on one Syria turn). Every survivor now keys the briefed channel. Nothing to configure.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A deleted player flight no longer leaves a dynamic-spawn link behind.** With dynamic slots on, a base's warehouse entry links to the player flight that seeds its dynamic spawns. The link was written onto the map's airfield object, which lives for the whole session, so a flight you removed after generating once left its link in every later mission and it then pointed at whatever group had taken that id — on one Syria turn, a red bomber. Links are now cleared before each generation writes its own.
* **[Campaign]** **A second pilot in your flight gets a sortie record on a multiplayer host.** The recorder told humans from AI by asking the unit for its player name, and on a listen host the remote pilot's jet answered that only in shot and hit events, not in the recorder's sweep, so he was filed as an AI wingman with no track and no logbook or lifetime profile entry. The sweep now also takes the server's own player list, and a name that arrives with a later event fills the record in.
* **[Campaign]** **The auto-planner frags the EWR before the SAM it covers.** A Skynet-held SAM stays dark until its target is inside its kill zone, and DCS AI fires a HARM only at a radar that is emitting, so an AI DEAD flight sent at a covered site never got a shot off: on one Persian Gulf turn a DEAD four-ship and its escort died to an SA-11 without firing, while the same fit at an SA-11 that had already lit up killed two launchers. Opportunistic DEAD now offers the detectors covering a planned target before the long- and medium-range SAMs; once the EWR is dead, Skynet runs the site autonomous and live from mission start and the next DEAD can shoot. A SAM that threatens a planned strike is still serviced first, as before. Nothing to configure.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Neutral countries are shaded to their border on the F10 map.** A detailed border was thinned for the fill in a way that could make it cross itself, and MOOSE stops filling at a crossing. Saudi Arabia on the Persian Gulf map was 18.7 % shaded; nine countries were under 95 %. Every shipped country now shades at least 98 %.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Enemy air defences run on Skynet again.** The MOOSE MANTIS IADS bridge the fork ran from June is removed and the IADS engine is upstream's Skynet-IADS, on upstream's MIST; the MIST-to-MOOSE shim went with it. The reasons, measured: the June parity note recorded no Skynet defect, every IADS bug since was in MANTIS or the fork's bridge, and the engine swap was 5% of the fork's diff from upstream rather than the bulk of it. The compiled Skynet carries the High Digit SAMs Ultimate Compilation profiles (S-400, S-300V4, SAMP/T, Pantsir-SM — the fork's own #851 work, as upstream #956 ships it) and the CurrentHill Russia, US, UK, Germany and China SAM profiles from HFXLegion's Skynet fork, so modded sites join the network. Two fork additions to the bridge, both harness-tested: a comms, power or command node destroyed on an earlier turn is registered as a dead stand-in — Skynet reads a site with no such object as fully connected, so without this the SAMs behind a bombed power station came back next mission — and a ground-starting AWACS is added to the net once it spawns instead of being skipped. The MANTIS options page is gone; Skynet's options (mobile-SAM shoot-and-scoot, go-live ranges, the F10 status menu) are back. Campaigns that preseeded `mantisiads` now preseed `skynetiads`. Existing saves load; the old engine pin is dropped on load. Every other MOOSE plugin is untouched. Design note `docs/dev/design/retlab-skynet-return-notes.md`; in-game row G42.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The King can find the survivor and brief the rescue.** A player-flown C-130J fragged as CSAR now gets a **KING | On-Scene Commander** F10 menu. **Take DF cut** gives a bearing to the survivor's beacon; two cuts from positions at least 15° apart make a **fix**, marked on the map with its error, which tightens with more cuts and closer range — inside 15 nm with line of sight the pod simply has the survivor. **Threat sweep** looks 8 nm around the fix and reports the closest five ground threats as a class (SAM, AAA, MANPADS, armour, troops) with a bearing and range **from the survivor**, each marked roughly — never a unit type, never an exact point. **Pass picture** sends the brief and the same marks to any player-crewed Sandy or rescue helicopter, or to all of them. The King cues only: nothing lases, and no task is ever pushed onto an AI flight. **One or the other:** a C-130J tasked CSAR gets this menu and not the EW/ISR one; tasked JAMMING it gets EW/ISR and not this. Nothing to configure; it needs a human in the King.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The A-10 and the Apache fly Sandy again.** A rescue escort is a mission type once more: create a package on a downed pilot, add a flight, and pick **Sandy**. The flight gets a short armed track centred on the survivor — covering the pickup while the helicopter works — instead of the front-line track a CAS flight flies, and it defaults to the Sandy callsign. **Only the A-10A/C/C-II and the AH-64A/D/D-II offer it**, and capability comes from the aircraft data, so no other airframe in the wing can be fragged for it. **Frag it by hand: the auto-planner never adds one**, because coordinating a rescue is a job for a human and an AI Sandy would orbit while the helicopter did the work. This is not the removed SCAR feature restored — that had a plugin and a scenario runtime, and both stay gone. Nothing to configure, nothing to convert; it appears on the next mission you plan.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The front line in the cockpit did not match the front line on the map.** The data cartridge drew each front as a straight line between its two ends, while the F10 map and the web map both draw the bowed trace the front-line model actually produces — so a salient you planned against showed up in the jet as a ruler. And each front went on its own display line, which on a theatre with three or four fronts drew three or four disconnected 50-mile dashes rather than a border. The cartridge now draws **one continuous boundary** with the same bulges the map shows, ordered across the theatre and joined between fronts. It is the same change in all four cartridges — Hornet, Viper, Tomcat and Apache. **The trade, stated plainly:** the stretches of border nobody is fighting over are joined with a straight line, because the campaign has no model of where an unopposed border runs; a straight join cannot invent a bulge that is not there, but on a wide theatre it will cut across rear-area ground. The Viper also had an invented limit of 8 points per line set; the jet's own editor caps the page at 25 points with no per-set limit, so the boundary now takes the whole first line set and three sets are free. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The tanker and the AWACS are drawn as boxes you can see.** Their orbits already reached the jets as points, but a point is not an area — and on the Hornet's situational-awareness page only the **selected** orbit draws its racetrack, so the gas was invisible unless you went looking for it. Each tanker and AEW&C orbit is now a closed box around the real racetrack: the straight legs plus the room the turns need, aligned to the orbit's own heading. The Hornet draws them on the three area lines that **shipped empty in every cartridge ever generated**; the Viper on its second, third and fourth map lines; the Tomcat as closed plot lines; the Apache as extra lines on the TSD. **The trade on the Viper only:** its map-line page holds 25 points for everything, so three boxes cost 15 and the front line is thinned to fit. Boxes win that contest deliberately — a box missing a corner is nonsense, a front line with fewer bends is still a front line. Follows the existing "Own orbit + tanker/AWACS orbits" checkbox on the Edit Flight DTC tab.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The Viper can carry its countermeasure programs, off by default.** MAN 1 dispenses flares only and MAN 5 chaff only, so one button answers an infrared shot and another a radar one; the three AUTO programs and BYP keep the jet's own values, and the bingo counts are the stock 10 and 10. **Default off, deliberately:** the F-16C manual says the CMDS MODE knob must be at STBY before a cartridge writes the MPD page, and the cartridge auto-loads on a cold jet where the knob is elsewhere — nobody has yet read the CMDS page after an auto-load to see what happens. Tick **Countermeasure programs** on the Edit Flight DTC tab to use it. The Hornet cannot have this: its cartridge format has no countermeasures section at all.
* **[Campaign]** **A pilot logbook that outlives the campaign.** The per-pilot career added alongside this lives in the save, so a new campaign starts it over. This one does not: a **Pilot Logbook** button on the toolbar — it opens with no campaign loaded — shows lifetime sorties, combat sorties, hours, air/ground/naval kills, ejections, a breakdown per aircraft type, the campaigns flown, and the individual flights. Pilots are identified by their **DCS player name**, which the mission recorder already read and discarded, so there is no setup and a host running a squadron event records every pilot who flew to their own profile rather than collapsing them into one. The store is `pilot_profiles.json` beside the other Retribution settings under Saved Games, never the save game, which is what lets it survive starting over. A mission is folded exactly once, guarded on a per-game id rather than the campaign name so that replaying a campaign records its sorties again instead of being mistaken for the playthrough already on file. Only slots a human actually occupied are recorded, and only aircraft that actually flew. No ranks or awards here — those stay with the campaign career. Setting `lifetime_pilot_profiles`, default on; turning it off writes nothing and keeps what is already recorded.
* **[Campaign]** **Pilots keep a career logbook.** Every pilot now carries a permanent record across the campaign: sorties, combat sorties, hours airborne, air/ground/naval kills, ejections, a rank and awards. A **Logbook** button in the squadron dialog opens it. The numbers are folded from the per-flight sortie records the mission already writes, so they count aircraft that actually flew — a counters-only wingman entry and a jet parked on the ramp both log nothing. Kills are new: `S_EVENT_KILL` is the only DCS event that names a killer, and it is now recorded onto the shooter's sortie record and split by what was hit. A kill counts only when both coalitions resolve and differ, so a blue-on-blue is never credited. Ranks and awards live in `resources/pilot_career.yaml` rather than in code — three rank ladders and nine awards ship, and a squadron ranks against the ladder naming its DCS country. This is a record, not a reward: nothing in it unlocks an aircraft, changes availability or gates a mission. The SITREP gains a line when one of your pilots earns an award. Setting `pilot_career_logbook`, default on; a campaign carried over from an older save starts its careers at zero, because the sortie records those turns would have been folded from are gone. Answers upstream issue #965.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Escorts flew ahead of the strikers they were escorting.** The leg between the join point and the ingress was the one piece of a package's route that every flight priced on its own, so nothing held a package together across it. Measured on a Syria turn: an F-16CM SEAD escort held **542 kt at 22,000 ft** while the F/A-18C it was escorting held **478 kt at 21,000 ft** — mach 0.89 against mach 0.78, with both briefed the same mach 0.85. That leg is now flown at the package's speed, as the join, the target and the split already were. **The cause was not the loadout**, which is worth saying because it is the obvious suspect and it is wrong: the faster Viper carried the *larger* share of stores (4,401 kg against 3,249 kg of internal fuel, versus the Hornet's 4,693 kg against 4,900 kg), so weighing the bombs predicts the wrong aircraft. What is left is the airframe itself, and DCS publishes no drag figures — so **cruise speed is now set per aircraft type wherever one has been measured**, instead of assumed identical for every supersonic jet. **The F/A-18C is the first and so far the only one authored, at mach 0.78.** **The trade, stated plainly:** that figure comes from a Hornet carrying two 2,000 lb JDAMs and two tanks, and the setting is per aircraft type with no way to tell one loadout from another — so **every** Hornet now transits about 5% slower, combat air patrol included. The Hornet's own measured fuel data was taken at mach 0.85 on a lighter jet, so a clean Hornet reading near 0.85 on the F10 map is the evidence that would reopen the figure. **Every other aircraft is unchanged.** Existing saves need nothing; it takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Theatre-missile sites no longer try to relocate during the mission.** The shoot-and-scoot feature never once moved a site in a flown mission, across three attempts to make it work. The launchers hold a scripted fire mission, and a DCS group that has fired refuses the route push that would drive it away afterwards; the two fixes for that (holding a site until its fire window passes, then giving the fire task a stop condition so it completes) both landed and neither helped. The final measurement, on a 72-minute Caucasus turn with six sites: **maximum movement 44.5 metres against a 4-kilometre scoot radius**, with two of the six held past the end of the mission by fire windows scheduled after it ended. The setting, its plugin and its four campaign preseeds are gone. **Missile sites themselves are unchanged** — they still generate, still carry their full support section, and still fire their volleys; they are stationary targets, which is what they were before this was built and what they have been in practice the whole time. Existing saves need nothing.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Every country on the map now has its real border, and the ones staying out of the war defend them.** Countries that are nobody's ally used to be scenery. Each nation on the map -- including the one the map is named after -- is now drawn with its actual border, taken from public-domain map data and shipped with the terrain, so no campaign authors anything. **Whose side a country is on is read from the airfields inside it**: a country whose fields you hold is yours, one where both sides have a field is contested and claimed by neither, and one already in the war is drawn as an outline only. **Whether you may cross comes from the same airfields** -- you can fly over a country you fly from, and over one both sides fly from. Everything else is closed. **A country that is closed stands surface-to-air batteries inside its own border**, on the map from the moment the mission starts, so you can find it on radar before you cross rather than discovering the border by tripping it. **What it fields follows the era and the country's size, and so does how many it stands** -- a legacy campaign sees SA-2, SA-3 and SA-5, a modern one SA-10 and SA-11, with Rapier, Hawk and Patriot for the nations on western kit; a small country gets one short-ranged battery and a large one several long-ranged ones, spread along the stretch of border the war is near, each sitting far enough back that its reach only just covers the frontier. Cross anyway and it calls you on the radio immediately, and again if you stay. **Keep pressing -- stay past the engage timer, or drop something inside the border -- and the battery changes sides and engages.** Leave promptly and nothing happens. If both sides violate the same country it puts up a second battery. **This is for players only**: an AI flight that strays is never attacked, and the auto-planner does not know the borders exist, so it will still route you through one -- crossing is your call to make or avoid. Batteries are free and untracked; killing them changes nothing at the turn boundary. **Nobody has flown this yet.** An earlier version defended with a fighter patrol and was proven in game; the patrol was dropped and the battery replaces it, so that evidence does not carry over. Off by default: **Mission Generator -> General -> "Neutral-faction border defense"**, which also needs the **"Neutral border defense"** plugin ticked. Both the warning and engage timers, and whether the borders draw on the F10 map at all, are plugin options. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Campaign]** **New campaign — Syria: Anatolian Reach (2004).** Israel and a US carrier group against a Turkey–Russia bloc, with Syria as the third partner. The subject is range: every target that matters sits 250–400 nautical miles from the Negev, so Israeli strike squadrons launch from Hatzerim and Ramat David, tank off a US package flying out of Akrotiri, and press into Anatolia. Akrotiri deliberately carries **no combat aircraft** — only tankers, AEW&C and lift — because it is the closest blue base to seven of the nine Turkish fields and anything armed based there would simply fly the war instead of Israel. Red is a Turkish and Russian force in one order of battle: Turkish F-16s and Phantoms holding the south and west, Russian MiG-31s, Flankers and Fencers holding the deep east and the Syrian corridor, with an S-300 belt that makes the long transit a fight rather than just a long flight. 14 airfields, 17 control points, a carrier in the eastern Mediterranean, and a night mission roughly one turn in three as the campaign clock marches.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The data cartridge now covers the Apache, and on the Viper it fills the new ROE tab with this campaign's actual sides.** DCS's 2026-08-26 patch gave the AH-64D a data cartridge and the F-16C an ROE tab, and both now arrive pre-loaded at spawn like the Hornet/Viper/Tomcat cartridges before them. **The Apache** gets its briefed route as named waypoints with the ALPHA route sequenced over them (leg speeds and ETAs computed), every enemy SAM site your side has actually found as named target points, and the front line drawn on the TSD -- both seats, no DTU work. **The Viper's ROE tab** ships from the factory with every aircraft type set UNKNOWN; the cartridge now sets the table from the campaign itself -- a family only your side flies is declared FRIENDLY, one only the enemy flies HOSTILE, and anything flown by both sides (or by nobody) stays UNKNOWN, so a shared type can never be vouched for. Friendly declarations are what draw the green circle from a single ROE factor, so the practical payoff is fewer blue-on-blue setups on the FCR. Both are checkboxes on the Edit Flight DTC tab and on by default; earlier saves pick the new sections up on their next generated mission with nothing to convert.
* **[Campaign]** **A Huey and a C-17 used to airlift the same amount, and a tank cost what an infantry squad cost.** Moving ground units between bases by air was sized by one number for the whole game -- a helicopter carried 1 unit, anything else carried 2 -- multiplied by a plain count of vehicles that knew nothing about what was in it. So a Gazelle and a C-5 Galaxy differed by a single unit, an An-26 lifted as much armour as a C-17, and a Huey could airlift a main battle tank. Capacity is now measured in **lift slots**, worth about seven tonnes each -- one army truck -- on both sides of the sum. **Cargo costs what it weighs**: an infantry squad 1, an APC 2, an IFV 3, artillery 4, a main battle tank 8. **Aircraft carry their real payload**: C-5 17, C-17 11, Il-76 7, A400M 5, Hercules 3, Mi-26 3, Chinook 2, An-26 1. Both tables come from the same anchor, so they stay proportional to each other. **A helicopter can no longer fly a tank anywhere** -- the heaviest helo in the game carries 3 slots and a tank needs 8 -- and a transfer led by armour will wait for a road or a ship rather than go by air. **The trade, stated plainly:** heavy transfers to a base with no road or sea link can now stall where they used to fly. Airlift is the fallback when no ground route exists, so an island or a cut-off field is where you would see it. Nobody has played a full campaign against this yet. **Aircraft nobody authored are unchanged**: 16 transports carry a real figure and every other airframe keeps the old constant, so nothing regresses quietly. Existing saves need nothing -- this is unit data, not saved state.
* **[Campaign]** **The bullseye stays put for the campaign, and the kneeboard says where it is.** It used to be re-derived every turn from whichever two opposing bases happened to be nearest each other, so the point a squadron memorizes moved whenever the front did -- and it moved again mid-turn on a base capture, a front-line shift, or any SAM bought or sold. It could also be planted on a **ship**: on a Marianas save blue's bullseye was a red carrier in open water, and because your own carrier is draggable on the map, repositioning it moved *red's* bullseye. The bullseye is now picked once and kept, and the anchor can never be a ship or an off-map field. It moves only if the front carries it more than 80 NM from where it would be picked now -- and on that one turn the kneeboard's Bullseye line reads **MOVED THIS TURN** so nobody flies to the old number. That line also **names the place** rather than only giving coordinates: `Bullseye: King Abdullah II - 32°00'20"N 36°13'25"E`. Nothing to configure, and it works on any campaign without authoring. **Existing saves:** the bullseye is re-picked once on the next turn, then held -- on the four saves tested, three land campaigns kept the same point and the Marianas one moved 61 NM off the carrier onto a land field.
* **[Mission Generation]** **One SAM launch no longer sends every jet in the area defensive.** DCS' stock threat reaction breaks an aircraft when it *perceives* a launch, not when a missile is guiding on it -- so a single S-300 or naval salvo scatters every flight in perception range, most of them from packages the missile was never aimed at. One measured salvo put **around 45 aircraft defensive, about 43 of them with nothing guiding on them**: transiting strikers broke formation, tankers and AWACS left their orbits, and packages arrived late or not at all for a shot that was aimed at somebody else. AI aircraft now fly the route and use chaff and flares as their default, and **only the flight the missile is actually guiding on** switches to evasive, until that missile is gone. Which flight that is comes from the engine itself -- the weapon is asked what it is tracking -- rather than being guessed from geometry, so it is neither a false break nor a missed one. DCS sets this per flight rather than per aircraft, so the targeted **flight** evades, not the single jet; two to four aircraft instead of forty-five is the change. **The trade, stated plainly:** a flight facing a missile the engine will not name a target for flies straight instead of breaking, so **AI losses in heavy SAM country can go up**. Nobody has measured that yet. **Helicopters are untouched** and keep stock behaviour. The host's F10 scramble bandits are exempt by design -- they exist to fight. Toggle is **Mission Generator -> Plugins -> "Smart threat reaction"**, on by default; turning it off restores stock DCS exactly, with nothing else changed. A **DEBUG** option prints every tagged shot on screen for testing and is off. Adopted from juanjux's fork. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[UI]** **Two BARCAP settings described themselves wrongly, and one of them can schedule an air tasking order hours past the mission.** A **carrier doubles the number of BARCAP waves planned**, and **"Max simultaneous carrier BARCAP waves"** is what turns that doubling into aircraft on station together rather than more waves one after another. At **1** it never stacks, so the doubled count is spent stretching the schedule. Measured on a Caucasus turn — 100-minute mission, 19 blue packages: at 1 the carrier flew four single waves at 4/64/124/184 minutes and **three packages were scheduled past the end of the mission**; at the default 2 the same four became two pairs, the last package moved to **95 minutes, and nothing fell off the end**. Every non-carrier package finished by 95 minutes either way, so this setting is the whole effect. Separately, **"Desired BARCAP on-station time"** said the wave count is *mission duration divided by on-station time*; that is true upstream, but this fork subtracts **BARCAP wave overlap** first, so the real divisor is the **fresh** coverage each wave adds — overlap does not add cover on top, it shortens each wave, which plans *more* of them. Both descriptions now say all of this. Text only — no planner behaviour changed.
* **[Campaigns]** **New campaign: Caucasus - Iron Gate.** Plob's *Northern Russia* is a good map layout with a 1995 date bolted to a modern premise — its own description has Russia invading Georgia through the eastern mountains, and it fought that out against **Russia 1975**. Iron Gate is RetLab's version of it: **June 2018 against Russia 2020**, all vanilla DCS. Red's Cold War regiments are re-equipped with their successors (MiG-21 and MiG-23 to the MiG-29S and Su-27, MiG-25 to the MiG-31, Su-17M4 to the Su-24M) and **every squadron is sized to the stands its base actually has** — the campaign used to ask for 324 red aircraft across 171 stands, which quietly left eleven squadrons with **no aircraft at all**, red's only AWACS and only tanker among them. Blue no longer flies everything out of Kutaisi, and now flies from **three fields at three different distances from the pass**: **Kutaisi at 27 miles is the helicopter field** — Hueys, Kiowas, Apaches, Chinooks and the Hercules, nothing else; **Kobuleti at 55 miles holds the strike wing** — Strike Eagles, Vipers and the Warthogs, 12 each on its 42 stands; and **Batumi at 73 miles holds the Eagles and nothing else**, because it has exactly ten stands and so exactly ten F-15Cs. The tankers and AWACS **spawn airborne** from a new off-map point over Turkey instead of taking up ramp. Squadrons of the same airframe at the same base are merged rather than duplicated, so the campaign runs **39 squadrons instead of 46 for the same aircraft** — and a merge takes the **union** of both units' tasks, so nothing loses a role on the way. **The LHA is gone**: it carried only Apaches and Chinooks, so they came ashore to Kutaisi and the ship came out of the mission. That one costs 20 aircraft — Kutaisi has 58 stands but only **25** take a helicopter, so five rotary squadrons now share what two used to, and the Huey and Kiowa halve. On the other side, **red's Hinds fly from its two FOBs**, not from airfields: four pads each, both closer to the fighting than the fields they came from, and the ten stands they vacate at Tbilisi-Lochini go to its jets — so red comes out four aircraft ahead. **Plob's Northern Russia still ships, completely unchanged.** **Two of blue's squadrons flew as nobody and now fly as real units**: the Warthogs named their own airframe, so they had no name, nickname or livery at all, and the Kiowas were a Taiwanese Army squadron wearing a fictional livery in a US-led coalition. They are now the **81st FS “Termites”** out of Spangdahlem and **1-17 Cavalry “Saber”**, both with their real liveries and both flying as USA so they get US radio voices and pilot names. NEW game required.
* **[UI]** **"Save Air Wing" wrote only the tab you were looking at.** The saved file was built from the front tab and recorded nothing about which coalition it held, so saving Red over a file that held Blue replaced it with no warning and nothing to recover from -- and loading a Red file with the Blue tab open handed blue the enemy's squadrons just as quietly. **Save now writes both coalitions to one file.** On load, a file holding both asks whether to restore both or only the side whose tab is open. **Air wing files you already have keep working**: they have no coalition marker, so they are treated as the old format and load into the current tab exactly as before -- nothing needs re-saving, though re-saving one converts it. The save prompt now says both sides are being written.
* **[UI]** **Editing a faction mid-campaign changed nothing you could buy.** A coalition's forces are built from its faction once, when the campaign starts, and each force group freezes the units it could reach at that moment. The rebuild was wired to preset-group changes alone, so **adding a unit did nothing** — add an early-warning radar and every EWR site still offered the SAM search radars it had fallen back to. Every kind of edit now rebuilds. **Two more in the same dialog:** the tick boxes never removed anything outside the New Game wizard — untick a unit from the in-campaign Air Wing button, close, and it was still there — so entries there get a remove button instead, which refuses while squadrons still fly the type or the map has it deployed. And both lists were ordered by internal DCS id rather than the name on screen, so they looked shuffled; they now sort alphabetically. The New Game wizard was never wrong and is unchanged. Adopted from juanjux's upstream dcs-retribution#953, with all three defects verified in our own tree first.
* **[Campaigns]** **Northern Russia asked its airfields for twice the aircraft they have room for.** Every squadron defaulted to 12, so Beslan's six squadrons wanted 72 aircraft on a **15-slot** ramp and Mineralnye Vody's eight wanted 96 on **28**. Squadrons are filled in list order until the ramp runs out, so the ones near the bottom got **nothing** -- in a turn-1 save that was 11 empty red squadrons including **the A-50 and the IL-78M, red's only AWACS and only tanker**. Adding `squadron_start_full` in the previous entry is what made this visible; the oversubscription was always there, hidden because squadrons used to start small and grow into whatever parking was free. **Every squadron now has an authored `size:` that fits its base**, and four red squadrons move from the two starved fields to Tbilisi-Lochini, which was sitting on 38 spare slots. Nothing is deleted: all 27 red and 23 blue squadrons survive, and red fields **171 aircraft instead of 133**. Support aircraft get sensible numbers rather than the default dozen -- AWACS and tankers 2, the Tu-95MS 4. **Tbilisi-Lochini is now red's biggest base at 7 squadrons**, and it is the red field closest to Kutaisi, so expect red air to answer faster in the west. NEW game required.
* **[Data]** **The Su-24MR could only fly combat air patrol.** DCS's dedicated recon Fencer declared exactly one task in its unit data -- `BARCAP: 0` -- so the only thing the planner could ever offer an unarmed photo-recon jet was fighter cover, and no faction fielded it at all. It is now **TARPS only**, matching the RF-101B and RA-5C. It also gets a `Retribution TARPS` loadout, without which a TARPS-tasked Su-24MR fell through every candidate loadout name and **spawned clean** -- no pods, no missiles, no tanks. The fit is a verbatim splice of the one DCS already ships (`SHPIL,ETHER,R-60M*2,Fuel*2`): Shpil-2 recon pod, ETHER ELINT pod, an R-60M pair for self-defence and two 3,000 L bags. The five shipped fits are untouched and still selectable in the payload editor. The airframe natively supports the DCS Reconnaissance task, so the recon behaviour resolves without a fallback. **Russia 2020 now fields it.** Seeing it fly needs the auto-planner's recon add-on switched on (**Campaign Doctrine -> "Auto-planner adds a recon flight to Strike/DEAD/Armed Recon packages"**, off by default since the planner re-convergence), or a hand-fragged TARPS flight. NEW game required for the faction change.
* **[Campaigns]** **Caucasus - Northern Russia moves to June 2018.** It was dated 1995-06-13 against **Russia 1975**, so a campaign about a modern Russian invasion of Georgia was fought against a Brezhnev-era air force. It now starts **2018-06-13** against **Russia 2020** (vanilla DCS, no mods), with **squadrons starting at full strength**. The 17 red squadrons that named a Cold War airframe are re-equipped with its successor rather than left to the assigner: MiG-21bis and MiG-29A become the MiG-29S and MiG-29A Fulcrum, MiG-23MLD becomes the Su-27, MiG-25PD becomes the MiG-31, and the Su-17M4 SEAD and Strike squadrons become Su-24Ms. **That part is not cosmetic.** A campaign squadron whose airframe is missing from the faction falls back to the first unclaimed squadron that can do the task, in dictionary order with no priority weighting -- and Russia 2020 has a BARCAP-capable L-39ZA, so 15 of the red fighter squadrons could have come up as jet trainers. All 27 red squadrons now resolve to the airframe the file names. Blue is untouched, including the MiG-23MLD squadron at Kutaisi. Fork-only: the campaign ships upstream and this re-dating is a RetLab call, not a defect fix. NEW game required.
* **[Factions]** **Russia 2020 is now vanilla DCS, and picks up what base DCS has gained since the roster was written.** It required the Su-57 mod, quietly drew on three more (Su-30 pack, Su-35S, MiG-31BM), and took eight of its eleven preset groups from High Digit SAMs -- so a player without those mods got a Russia whose best fighters and every SAM above the Buk silently vanished. The whole roster now resolves against base DCS and `requirements` is empty. **Removed:** Su-57, Su-30MKA/MKI/MKM/SM and their A-G variants, Su-35S, MiG-31BM; the S-400, S-300V/VM/V4, S-300PMU-1/PMU-2, S-300PS-B and SA-17 preset groups; Pantsir-SM and the Nebo-U/Nebo-SVU EWRs. The vanilla Su-30 Flanker-C carries the same task set the modded Flankers did, so multirole coverage survives; the long-range ceiling drops to the S-300PS. **Added, all base DCS.** ED shipped the CurrentHill assets pack into the core game, which is where most of the new kit comes from: T-90M, BMPT Terminator, TOS-1A, Iskander-M and Iskander-K, Pantsir-S1, Tor M2, and both Project 22160 patrol ships. Alongside those: T-72B3, T-80B, BTR-82A/80/70/60/D, BRDM-2, MT-LB, BMP-1, T-55A; Grad, Smerch (HE and cluster), Gvozdika, Akatsiya, Nona-S; KAMAZ, GAZ-66 and ZIL trucks; the 2B11 mortar and the earlier Igla; the cruiser Moskva, a Grisha corvette and a second Kilo; and the An-26B, An-30M and Mi-26. Preset groups gain SA-6, the single-radar S-300PS (for regiment-style belts) and the SA-9/SA-15/SA-19/ZSU-23-4 SHORAD sites. **The JTAC drone was an MQ-9 Reaper** -- an American UAV spotting for Russia -- and is now the WingLoong-I, matching Redfor (Russia) 2020. The modded rosters are untouched: **[CH] Russia 2020** and **Redfor (Russia) 2020** still carry the CurrentHill and High Digit SAMs kit. A save stores its faction, so an existing campaign keeps the old roster -- NEW game required.
* **[UI]** **The New Game map filter names the map instead of its folder.** The Map dropdown was built from each campaign's raw `theater:` key, so it listed `MarianaIslands` against `MarianasWWII` -- two maps of the same islands, next to each other, near-impossible to tell apart. It now shows each theater's own name, so those read `Mariana Islands` and `Marianas WWII`. `GermanyCW` and `SinaiMap` were pydcs identifiers showing through for the same reason and are now `Germany Cold War` and `Sinai`. Filtering is unchanged -- it still matches on the key behind the label.
* **[Campaigns]** **Marianas - Operation Forager (1944).** The first campaign on the Marianas WWII terrain. 15 June 1944: the Marines hold the Charan Kanoa beach strip on Saipan and nothing else, Task Force 58 stands off to the west, and the other nine airfields across Saipan, Tinian, Rota and Guam are Japanese. Blue grinds north to Aslito and then across the strait; the islands are joined to each other only by sea. Corsairs fly from the Essex, Thunderbolts from the beach strip, and the Japanese garrison fights with its own guns -- a Type 88 and Type 96 flak battery per field. DCS ships no Japanese aircraft, so the I-16 and Fw 190 A-8 stand in for the defenders in the IJN liveries DCS ships for that purpose.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The kneeboard's theater map was drawn from the wrong part of the picture.** Every page that falls back to the shipped theater image — the recon pages when satellite tiles are unavailable, which is any offline generation — located its crop using pydcs's `terrain.bounds`, then clamped the crop to the image rather than failing when it did not fit. The result looked like terrain and was not: it was ground from somewhere else, with your steerpoints and threat rings drawn on top. `terrain.bounds` does not bound the map — **24 of Syria's 224 airfields sit outside it**, the entire Jordanian corner and the Negev among them (King Abdullah II, Muwaffaq Salti, Nevatim, Hatzerim), plus 23 of Normandy's 89, 4 of Persian Gulf's and 2 of Nevada's. Worse, pydcs declares Syria, Normandy and Persian Gulf upside down relative to its own convention, which made the north-south scale negative and collapsed **every Syria crop to a single row of pixels stretched over the whole page**. This was not confined to the map edges: a Tabqa page, comfortably inside the picture, drew ground centred **215 km south and 58 km east** of what it asked for, and a Batumi page came out **116 km east** showing 38×33 km where 80×80 km was requested. Each theater image now carries a measured world rectangle, taken from the two reference airfields the old pre-2021 map used to place these same pictures and re-derived against each image's current size — checked against the airfields independently, with none of Caucasus's 21 or Nevada's 17 landing in the sea. **The crop now refuses instead of stretching.** Ask for ground the picture does not cover and you get the plain coastline map instead: less pretty, but every marker is where it belongs. That includes **Cyprus**, which `syria.gif` never drew at all — all 25 of the island's airfields sit over open water in it, so pages there fall back too. **The Package Targets Map now shows terrain as well.** It used to draw land as a flat tan fill; it now uses the same theater imagery wherever that imagery reaches, which on the shipped campaigns is **15 of the 42** on a theater that has one. Compact campaigns win (Red Flag 81-2, the WRL battles, Scenic Route, Golan Heights); theater-wide ones keep the flat fill, because these pictures were drawn for smaller maps than DCS now ships — `syria.gif` covers 619×905 km of a theater whose airfields span 763×709 km. Where the page's own margin is the only thing pushing it off the picture, the map slides sideways to stay on the imagery rather than give it up, so **your packages may sit slightly off-centre**; they are never cropped, and no airfield name is lost. This map never touches the network. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Campaign]** **A sunk carrier now takes its squadrons down with it.** Grounding the air wing keyed on the hull being classed an aircraft carrier, and both the LHAs and the WWII Essex are classed helicopter carriers -- so sinking one left its squadrons flying from a ship on the seabed. The Essex carries that class deliberately, because it is what the engine tests before swapping in the straight-deck carrier control point, so the hull was exempt from its own sinking. A second fault hit the supercarriers as well: squadrons were removed while the list holding them was being walked, so wherever two squadrons shared one aircraft type the second survived.

* **[Mission Generation]** **Package target names no longer drift away from their targets.** On a busy map the Package Targets Map pushed a crowded name down the page looking for a clear spot, with no limit on how far it could travel — so a name could end up a third of the page from the dot it belonged to, sitting beside some unrelated airfield, and an airfield name could end up over open water. Measured on a Syria BAI turn, one target name landed **166 px** from its own marker. A name now stays within reach of its marker, and one that still has to be offset gets a thin leader line back to it. Nothing is dropped that used to be drawn.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The threat page told you to fly a sortie that cannot answer the question.** Every unidentified contact on the Threat Intel kneeboard — AAA, EWR, MERAD and SHORAD alike — was briefed "Fly TARPS to ID". Photo recon stopped revealing sites when *engaging* a site became the only thing that identifies it, so that instruction sent pilots after an answer no TARPS pass could bring home. The page's own opening line already said "engage them to ID", so the card contradicted itself top to bottom. Every row now reads **"Engage to ID."** The same dead instruction in the COIN high-value-target test notes went with it. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The loadout line was hiding stores you are carrying.** The one-line ordnance summary under the BLUF dropped external fuel tanks entirely, and counted a rack carrying two bombs as one. A flown F-16CM briefed `2× AIM-120B · 2× AIM-9M · Mk 82 · CBU-97 · HTS` while actually carrying two Mk-82s, two CBU-97s **and two 370 gal tanks** — the tanks being the reason its fuel ladder started at 11,921 lb rather than 7,163. It now reads `2× AIM-120B · 2× AIM-9M · 2× CBU-97 · 2× bag · 2× Mk 82 · HTS`. **The fuel figures themselves were always right** and are unchanged; it was the store list that disagreed with them. ECM pods are still left off the ordnance line and the HTS still collapses to its own tag. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Campaign]** **Ground objects no longer spawn on an enemy airfield's doorstep.** A campaign's authored markers are bound to a control point by influence zone: a marker inside a zone joins that base, and a marker inside none falls back to the nearest base **with no zone at all**. That second rule has a sharp edge nobody noticed — a base whose zone hugs its runway cannot adopt its own outlying markers, so they skip it and land on whatever unzoned field is nearest, however far away that is. In **Syria - Desert Trident** six armour groups and a fuel depot sitting 15–25 km from red King Abdullah II belonged to **blue Ben Gurion, 110–140 km away**, which put blue armour on the doorstep of a red airfield and made Ben Gurion the owner of 26 ground objects scattered across half the map. A nearby zoned base now adopts a marker the fallback would otherwise strand: within 25 km of the base, and only when the fallback would place it more than 50 km from its owner. Both limits matter — without the first, a base claims anything it happens to be nearest to; without the second, healthy campaigns get reshuffled (proximity alone moved 14 Marianas markers between neighbouring fields that were already 2–12 km away, for no reason). Measured across every shipped campaign: **16 of 7,653 bindings move and not one ends up farther from its owner** — old distances of 53–142 km become 9–25 km. Eight campaigns are affected, Desert Trident most; its placement warning goes from seven objects to none. NEW game required — bindings are decided when the campaign is generated.
* **[Campaign]** **The front line behaves like a front line.** Where the front sat was one number divided by another: each base's abstract strength, a figure between 0 and 1, with the line placed at their ratio along a fixed route. It knew nothing else. Two bases both at full strength met exactly in the middle whether one held five vehicles or five hundred; every base healed a fixed amount every single turn whether or not anything could reach it, so ground you took drained back on a timer; winning a battle cost the same whether you were assaulting or dug in, which let a front slide back and forth over the same ground for free; and the line ran dead straight regardless of what it was crossing. Five changes, each with its own setting and all of them on: **Bases only rebuild if supply reaches them** — a road or sea route back to a rear area recovers in full, air resupply alone at a quarter, cut off entirely at nothing. Take the crossroads behind an enemy base and it stops replacing what you kill. (The route's *kind* is what counts, not whether one exists — every friendly airfield is connected to every other by air, so "is there a path" is true almost everywhere.) **Attacking costs more than defending** — win while pushing forward and you keep part of the ground, not all of it; win dug in and it costs you nothing. Fronts hold until pushed and give when they break. **The line counts the forces actually there** — how much armour each side has at that base now matters as much as how well it is holding up. **Terrain slows an advance** — pushing through ground your vehicles cannot cross costs several times what the same distance of open country costs, so fronts stall at passes and river crossings. An even fight still sits at the midpoint whatever the terrain, so no existing campaign's front starts anywhere new. **And the line bows instead of running straight** — sectors facing open ground sit forward of sectors backed against bad terrain, ground units are placed along the bulge, and the F10 map draws it. Existing saves pick all five up on their next turn; turning any of them off restores exactly the old behaviour. Settings are under **Campaign Management → Campaign features**, and on the RetLab Features page under **Ground war**.
* **[Campaign]** **Missions now report back what the flying actually was.** When you landed, the campaign learned one thing: which units died. Everything else about a two-hour mission was thrown away — where anyone went, how long they stayed, what they shot. Every feature that needed more than a casualty list had to cut its own private channel back from the mission, and there are seven of them. There is now one record per flight covering its track, time airborne, fuel, shots and hits, and the campaign summary reports the day's flying: *"14 sorties, 22.5 hours airborne, 31 shots for 12 hits"* — the first thing the campaign has ever been able to say about a mission that is not a count of the dead. **No third-party software is needed.** Tacview does this and more, but it is a paid separate program, so anything built on it would quietly do nothing for most players; this reads DCS itself. Deliberately cheap, and careful about multiplayer: **every human-crewed cockpit is tracked separately**, because four people in one flight do not fly the same route — one can be shot down fifty miles from the others. An AI flight tracks one aircraft, since wingmen hold formation. Positions are read every 30 seconds and each aircraft keeps four hours of them, so a tanker or AWACS orbiting all mission still has its start. The track is written **once, at mission end** rather than into every periodic save, because the results file is rewritten every fifteen seconds and a big mission's worth of track is expensive to encode on the same thread that is flying the sim. If DCS crashes mid-mission you lose the track but keep everything the results file carried before this feature existed. If the recorder ever faults it is isolated — the loss reporting it shares a file with keeps working. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Flights that finished before your startup now actually leave jets on the ramp.** With the living-battlespace pre-roll on, a flight whose whole sortie ran before you walk out is supposed to park its jets, engines off, at its recovery field. In practice almost none ever appeared: the fast-forward removes a finished flight from the air tasking order the moment it completes, so by the time the mission was built there was nothing left to park — a one-tick window meant the ramp stayed empty however long the pre-roll ran. Finished flights are now handed to mission generation directly, so recovered jets sit on the ramp where they landed (they are real airframes — strafing them costs the enemy real aircraft), and the briefing's "The air war so far today" line counts them instead of always reporting `recovered 0`. Jets park where the flight actually landed, even if you order that squadron to move somewhere else before takeoff. Off by default like the rest of the pre-roll; with it off nothing changes.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The carrier's into-wind course turned the wrong way — fixed.** The angled-deck recovery heading shipped below solved its wind triangle to the wrong side of the wind: the boat offset its course *counterclockwise* of the wind reciprocal, which lines the relative wind up with a landing area angled to **starboard** — no carrier has one. On every hull with an angled deck the felt wind ended up twice the deck angle off the real landing area (about **7.7 kt of crosswind** on a Nimitz-class deck at 25 kt wind over deck), which is *worse* than the old bow-into-wind behavior (about 3.9 kt) the feature replaced. The course now offsets clockwise, and the relative wind runs straight down the angled deck with zero crosswind, which is the whole point of the feature. Found working checklist row B55 on a Baltic Fury generation: with wind from 191° at 9 kt, the boat sailed 166° pre-fix and sails 216° post-fix at the same 16.4 kt. Expect BRC to sit on the *other* side of the wind reciprocal than it did — up to ~25° in light wind — and the kneeboard and CV Operations Data page follow it. Escorts are unaffected (straight decks solve unchanged). NEW mission required.
* **[UI]** **Fixed 13 settings sections that did not render at all.** A section hid itself when it had no rows left to show, and the "Show N advanced options" link sits inside that section — so any section made up entirely of numeric tuning knobs disappeared, link and all. 47 settings were reachable only by typing their name into the search box: the **2/3/4-ship flight-size weights** and the primary-task distance factor (Campaign Management → Flight-planner automation), the procurement balance and reserve knobs (Commander economy), the motorpool cap, both alternate victory conditions, the comms-war and cargo-convoy limits, and **every Air Doctrine tuning group** — CAP and support timing, auto-planner behavior, altitudes, engagement ranges, SEAD standoff, support-orbit standoff and mission range limits. Nothing was lost or reset: the values were intact in the save and the planner was reading them the whole time. A section of nothing but knobs now shows them straight away, and collapsing one by hand leaves the link to bring it back.
* **[UI]** **Plugin options that do nothing now look like it.** A plugin option whose feature is switched off elsewhere in the same plugin used to sit there fully lit, inviting you to tune a number the script never reads. Those options are now greyed out along with their labels, and un-grey the moment you turn the thing they depend on back on. Thirteen options across five plugins are wired up: MANTIS' point-defense wake duration, radius and suppression reach (dead without SEAD-triggered point defense) and its C2 poll interval and comms-loss policy (dead without advanced C2); CTLD's JTAC smoke and FC3 laser code (dead without autolase); the cruise-missile defender-wake radius and hold time (dead without defender wake); Airboss' rescue duration, zone radius and UH-60 mod switch (dead without the rescue helo); and the Vietnam naval-gunfire auto interval (dead without automatic bombardment). Each one was checked against the plugin's own script rather than guessed from its name — three options that *looked* dependent turned out to still do something and were deliberately left alone. Nothing about how any of them behave has changed: a greyed option keeps its value and is still passed to the mission exactly as before. Display only.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The carrier now steams for wind down the angled deck, not down the bow.** Carriers pointed their bow straight into the wind. Real ones don't — the landing area is offset to port (9° on a Nimitz, 10.5° on a Forrestal or an SCB-125 Essex, 7.95° on Kuznetsov), so bow-into-wind leaves a permanent crosswind across the deck you're actually landing on. The boat now solves a heading and speed that put ~25 kt straight down the **angled** deck with near-zero crosswind, using each hull's own deck angle. In very light wind (below ~4 kt) it falls back to the old bow-into-wind behavior, because the crosswind term has no solution there. **Fixed along the way:** above 25 kt of ambient wind the old code computed a **negative** carrier speed and wrote it into the ship's route; speed is now floored at zero and the deck is aligned with the ambient wind instead. Expect BRC to sit up to ~15° off the wind reciprocal — that is the ship's real heading, and the kneeboard and CV Operations Data page follow it. Helicopter decks and straight decks are unchanged. Adopted from geofffranks' work on upstream issue dcs-retribution#865. NEW mission required.
* **[Air Doctrine]** **Air-defense planning geometry returns to stock Retribution.** The fork had rebuilt where CAP, AWACS and tankers sit and how many CAP waves each base gets. That work is removed and the stock behaviour is back, as part of a decision to return default auto-planner behaviour to upstream Retribution. What changes: **CAP volume is flat again** — every defended base gets the same number of waves (a fleet objective still gets double) instead of contested sectors earning up to twice as many; **the forward CAP line is gone**, so a base is defended because an enemy airfield is near it, not because it holds the front, and the AI can once again leave a front-anchor base uncovered when it decides to go offensive; **the extra forward CAP screen** the AI flew on large maps is removed; **AWACS and tanker orbits anchor on the objective they support** and stand off from the nearest threat, rather than sitting behind the front line — they no longer spread apart from one another when several are up, and the AI no longer holds its support aircraft deeper than yours; **CAP orbits no longer shift forward** in busy sectors; and **the front line is no longer an obstacle for route planning**, so transiting flights may again route over the ground battle. Escort planning also goes back to the stock test for whether a route is threatened by enemy fighters, which means **fewer packages near the front will be assigned a fighter escort** — including CAS, which is what pulls TARCAP. Kept: the overlapping CAP waves, the strike-escort reserve (Vietnam only), the fix for CAP orbits collapsing behind a base that sits inside a threat ring, and player QRA. Affects planning from the next turn; no new game needed.
* **[Campaign]** **The auto-planner's commander behaviour returns to upstream.** Thirteen RetLab planner changes that fired in every game, with no setting to turn them off, are reverted to stock DCS Retribution: the modern-doctrine BARCAP trim that held 8 fighters back for strike escorts; the extra CAS package on every contested front; the trimmed escort set (SEAD Sweep is proposed again, and DEAD composes its escorts the stock way); the DEAD reachability gate that deferred strikes behind a live SAM belt; the fixed 4-ship Armed Recon and the 2-ship floor on Strike (both back to the stock size roll); the escort-need test and the escort-availability test; simultaneous ASAP AWACS packages; the two theater-tanker changes (one tanker per boom/probe method, and moving it onto receiver demand after planning); the 3-minute SEAD lead (now 1); and the bounded SEAD loiter orbit (SEAD flies the stock search waypoint and attack tasking again). Vietnam doctrine keeps its own escort reserve, and the boom/probe compatibility data is untouched — only the planner's use of it changed. Existing saves load; a SEAD loiter waypoint in an old save reads as a nav point. Second slice of the 2026-08-09 planner re-convergence decision; the divergence audit (`docs/dev/design/retlab-autoplanner-upstream-divergence-audit.md`) is the map.
* **[Air Doctrine]** **Tanker planning returns to stock, and drop tanks are no longer fitted for you.** The fork planned tankers from fuel: it walked each sortie's route, worked out the burn, fitted drop tanks to empty stations to cover it, and only then decided whether the flight needed gas on the way in, on the way out, both, or not at all. That is removed. Tanker tasking is Retribution's again — **every non-helicopter flight in a strike package gets a refuel waypoint whenever your wing can plan a tanker**, on the egress leg only, with no fuel math behind it. What you will notice: no pre-target tanker stops, more flights carrying a refuel waypoint they may not need, and **aircraft fly the tanks their loadout actually specifies** — nothing is added at planning or at mission generation, so a jet fragged for a long leg on a short-legged preset is now your call to fix in the payload editor. The two settings that drove it (**Add fuel tanks when the route needs the range** and **Trade jammer pods for fuel tanks**) are gone; existing saves load fine and drop the stored values. Kneeboard fuel figures are unchanged — the ladder, the bingo estimate and the payload-tab fuel readout still count the tanks a jet is carrying, and a patrol still pays for its time on station. Part of a wider return of the auto-planner to upstream behaviour.
* **[Campaign]** **New games plan like upstream DCS Retribution by default.** The seven RetLab planner gates that used to ship enabled — overlapping BARCAP waves, SEAD-window strike timing, automatic recon add-on flights, weather-aware planning, escort jammers, adaptive procurement, and the continuous campaign clock — now default to upstream's stock values. A new **Planner behavior** bar at the top of the Campaign Doctrine settings page switches all seven together ("Stock (upstream)" / "RetLab suite"), and each can still be tuned individually afterward. Existing saves keep their current values; only new games see the new defaults. First slice of the 2026-08-09 planner re-convergence decision — the divergence audit (`docs/dev/design/retlab-autoplanner-upstream-divergence-audit.md`) is the map of what changes next.
* **[Data]** Aircraft task weights return to upstream's numbers (planner re-convergence, 2026-08-09). 194 aircraft yamls restored, 1,184 weights. Auto-planner airframe picks match upstream again. Kept: the fork task lanes (TARPS, Jamming, Escort Jammer, CSAR), every fork task deletion (Intercept stays retired; the F-14s and other no-ARM airframes still carry no SEAD), `secondary_tasks` blocks, the S-3B sea-control and A-6E attack/tanker split, and the C-130J-30 task set. The two Intercept entries the retirement missed (F-14A-95-GR, F-100D) are deleted. The EA-18G and EA-6B keep SEAD Escort at 400 so strike fighters win that slot and the jammers stay on escort jamming. Applied by tools/restore_upstream_task_weights.py.
* **[Campaign]** Fuel estimates for aircraft without measured data are less pessimistic. For the ~217 airframes with no hand-measured fuel figures, the kneeboard fuel ladder and bingo estimate are derived from internal fuel capacity and one assumed cruise endurance. That figure was set to match the F/A-18C, the thirstiest aircraft measured at the time, so every unmeasured aircraft was treated as a Hornet — overstating cruise burn by up to 140%. Adopting the 12 measured blocks below grew the calibration set from 2 reference aircraft to 9, and the figure is re-derived from those: worst overshoot drops from +140% to +78%. A Fulcrum now estimates 10.6 lb/nm instead of 14.3, a Flanker 29.6 instead of 39.9. The estimate stays deliberately on the cautious side (over-estimating burn is safe, under-estimating strands an aircraft), so it is not tuned to the lowest average error. Aircraft with measured data are unaffected, as are helicopters and transports. Tanker auto-planning uses this estimate as a fallback, so tanker decisions for unmeasured aircraft shift accordingly.
* **[Data]** Measured fuel-consumption data added for 12 airframes: A-10A, A-10C (Suite 3 and Suite 7), A-4E, AV-8B, F-100D, all four F-14 marks, F-15C and F-4E-45MC. These previously had no measured data and fell back to an estimate derived from internal fuel capacity, which overshot real cruise burn by +35% (A-4E) to +140% (F-14). The kneeboard fuel ladder and bingo figures for these jets were pessimistic by up to 2.4x and are now correct. Measured coverage goes from 22 to 40 aircraft types. Measured data also drives tanker planning and the in-flight fuel sim, so tanker tasking for these 12 airframes changes as well. Data adopted from DCS Liberation; the F-4E figures are sourced from Dash-1 Supplemental Data and the Heatblur manual. Remaining airframes still use the estimate.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A missile battery finally looks like a battery — and launchers cost money.** A SCUD, Iskander, CJ-10 or ATACMS site generated as **three launchers and a UAZ-469 jeep**; the real thing is a small convoy of support vehicles around the launchers (the Iskander's own system list runs to a transporter/loader, a command-and-staff vehicle, an information-preparation station, maintenance and life support). Every missile site in the game — 33 of the shipped campaigns author one, from Desert Storm's nine Scud batteries to Red Tide's two — now generates with a **support park**: two cargo trucks, a transporter/loader, a fuel bowser, and a command-and-staff vehicle where the faction has one, all in that nation's own kit (Soviet Urals and a ZIL-131 KUNG; US M818s, a HEMTT M977 and a Trojan Spirit; an Opel Blitz pair and an Sd.Kfz.7 at a 1944 V-1 ramp). It reads as a real emplacement from the air, which is the point — these are the sites hiding under a suspected-activity circle that shoot and scoot between your recon passes. **Fixed along the way:** the site's single logistics slot picked *one* vehicle, so the fuel bowsers added last week were **replacing** the cargo truck instead of joining it; fuel is now its own slot. And **every launcher in the game was priced at zero** — Scud-B, Iskander, CJ-10, Shahed, the V-1 ramp and the whole coastal anti-ship family — while missile and coastal sites are purchasable and repairs are charged at the unit price, so the buy menu was handing out theatre ballistic missiles for free and rebuilding a bombed launcher cost nothing. They are now priced against the artillery scale (Scud-B 40, Iskander-M 70, DF-21D 85), which makes a full battery roughly 135 against an S-300 site's 230. NEW game required — a site's composition is decided when the campaign is generated.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Working out which mod launchers can actually drive is now a one-line log read.** A handful of launcher models DCS refuses to move — the vanilla Silkworm emplacement, and the CH CJ-10, whose three Marianas sites were measured moving **0.00 km** across two flown missions — and each one had to be identified by flying a mission and reading a Tacview afterwards, because the shoot-and-scoot script only ever logged *which group* was stuck. It now logs the unit types too, so `dcs.log` names the culprit directly, and the verdict is recorded in the unit's own data file rather than a list in the code — meaning the next one found is a data edit. Still unmeasured either way: the Iskander-M/K, DF-21D and YJ-12B launchers.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Recon confirms what you actually saw — one system for you and the AI.** Photo recon ran two completely separate implementations of the same job: your sorties went through a MOOSE film system with an F10 "take photo" menu, AI recon went through a simple overflight check. They could never agree, and the player half rested on reading a field off a MOOSE object whose format was **never confirmed** — a comment in the code said as much — so if that guess was wrong your recon banked *nothing at all*, silently, while AI recon kept working. That is now one shared rule. **Recon is automatic: fly the recon profile over the target and it confirms — there is no film menu to remember and no per-sortie photo limit.** A TARPS tasking on any airframe feeds it, and so does any drone whatever it was sent to do. How much you bring home now depends on how you flew it: a **dedicated recon pod** sees wider than a drone's camera ball, a **high fast pass resolves less** than a proper recon run (full take up to 20,000 ft, tailing off to about 40% by 40,000 ft), and **cloud cover costs you part of the take** — the campaign's weather finally matters to the one mission it most obviously should. **The read-out arrives when you land**, not while you are still over the target; a flight that never makes it home still banks what it photographed, because missions routinely end before everyone recovers. A recon flight shot down before the target still confirms nothing. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **JTAC is back to one model: the standard forward air controller over the front line.** The fork had grown a second, competing JTAC — a drone that rode your air-to-ground packages and lased from there — sitting behind its own setting, with the standard FAC suppressed whenever it was on. That is removed. There is now a single JTAC, exactly as Retribution intends it: the faction's JTAC aircraft orbiting the front line, invisible and immortal, lasing for CAS on the front's own laser code. It needs no setting and is gated on nothing but whether your faction fields a JTAC at all. The two settings that governed the drone version are gone; an existing save loads fine and simply ignores them.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Civilian traffic looks like the part of the world you are flying in.** The background civil layer used one aircraft roster everywhere, so Antonov freighters and Mi-8s cruised over **Nevada and the Marianas** as readily as over the Caucasus — and, worse, modern airliners and freighters flew over **1944 Normandy and The Channel**. Fleets, operators and cruise levels are now chosen per region: the Antonovs and Ilyushins stay where they belong (Caucasus, Kola, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq), western maps fly western kit, and **the WWII maps carry no civil traffic at all**, which is the honest answer for a 1944 combat theatre. Traffic is also named for who is flying it — you will see **`AEROFLOT 412`** on the F10 map instead of `CIV_An-26B_3`. And it flies like civil traffic now: a single long **transit across the map at a real flight level** rather than a meandering chain of short hops between rear airfields at 16,000 ft, which is both more convincing and far more likely to actually be *seen* from altitude. Traffic stays clear of the front and remains invisible to the AI. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Convoy ambushes no longer depend on a LUA plugin.** The ambush spring was a runtime script doing something DCS's own mission triggers already do, which meant an unticked "Convoy ambush" plugin silently disabled the setting you had turned on -- the reason seven campaigns had to force that plugin on behind your back. It is now written straight into the generated mission: a hidden trigger zone on the road that springs only when *that* convoy drives into it. **Nothing about how the feature plays has changed** -- same 6 km radius, same startup grace, same "TROOPS IN CONTACT" call and F10 mark, same losses-count-natively discipline. Two things do improve: a passing aircraft can no longer set off an ambush meant for the convoy, and DCS watches the zone continuously instead of the old 15-second poll. What changes for you: the setting is now the *only* switch, so a host whose saved defaults had the "Convoy ambush" plugin unticked will start getting ambushes. The plugin is gone.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Enemy ships hold station under way instead of parking on a coordinate.** A ship only ever got a course when the campaign was *moving* it somewhere; the rest of the time it generated with no route at all and sat perfectly still for the entire mission. Last turn's recon photo was always still good, so a coordinate written down once stayed valid forever and every hull was a stationary target — while your own carrier, which turns into wind to recover aircraft, visibly did move. Ship groups now patrol a **racetrack centred on their station**: they are under way from mission start, but the pattern is centred on the position the campaign map draws them at, so a group never drifts more than about **1.6 NM** from its marker however long you fly — deliberately tight, because a ship's threat ring is drawn at that marker and a wider wander would leave a short-ranged escort sitting outside its own engagement circle. A lap takes about 50 minutes, so a hull is visibly under way the whole mission. Groups orient themselves along whatever water they actually have, so a ship in a strait patrols up and down it rather than steaming at the shore, and one moored somewhere too tight to manoeuvre simply stays where it is. Carriers and assault ships are unchanged — they still steam into wind for recovery. Takes effect the next time a mission is generated; no new campaign needed.
* **[UI]** **A What's New button on the toolbar, so you know what changed before you fly.** The fork lands several player-visible changes a week and most of them are runtime behaviour you have to go looking for. The window lists the recent ones, newest first, and each carries a **Watch for** line: what to actually look for in the next mission. It reads a curated list shipped with the build rather than this changelog, which is grouped by area and so cannot say what is recent. Available before you open a save, since it describes the build rather than the campaign.
* **[Mission Generation]** **No more parked jets appearing on the deck when the carrier respots for recovery.** The recovery dressing was allowed static aircraft on the reasoning that it only stands once launches are over. It does not: on a flown CVN-71, 14 aircraft spawned onto that deck between 9 and 35 minutes after the dressing appeared, five of them onto the six-pack row -- and a spawning aircraft does not skip a blocked spot, it spawns into it. The recovery deck is deck gear again: tow tractors, the P-25, the crane and deck crew, rotating over five sets.
* **[Mission Generation]** **An empty warship can no longer answer an attack forever.** A ship that runs dry stays weapons-free while the enemy is shooting at it, because a ship holding fire does not defend itself at all -- but nothing bounded what that cost: a carrier that began a mission with an empty magazine fired twelve anti-ship missiles over six minutes, and announced itself winchester four times doing it. It now answers for one salvo past empty and then holds, even under fire, and says winchester once.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A warship no longer empties every anti-ship tube in one mission.** Naval magazines already made anti-ship missiles finite across a campaign, but a ship's campaign stock is deeper than the missiles it carries loaded, so a cruiser could still ripple its whole ready loadout the moment it went weapons-free -- 16 rounds in 36 seconds, in the flight this came from. A ship group now also stops after a set number of anti-ship missiles per mission (**Naval magazines & weapons release** plugin, default 6, 0 = no limit) and holds fire for the rest of the day. The magazine bounds the war; the salvo bounds the day. A group the enemy is shooting at keeps firing either way.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The Carrier Strike Group 8 screen is now three Ticonderogas and one Arleigh Burke**, instead of four Burkes and one Ticonderoga. The Ticonderoga is the group's area-air-defence ship, and what a modern anti-ship salvo is survived by is SM-2 magazine depth rather than hull count. Only this one named US layout changes; the mixed carrier and LHA screens, and every other navy, generate exactly as before.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Fly today's real sky.** With the **ATMOS-X** cloud preset pack selected, a new **Use ATMOS-X live weather** switch (**Mission Generation → Weather**) throws away the generated weather for the turn and flies a **real METAR observation** instead — actual pressure, temperature, wind at three levels, visibility and the cloud layer that is over that airfield right now. It is the turn's weather, not a decoration on the mission file: the kneeboard QNH and winds, the active runway and the carrier's course into wind all read the same observation. **Your campaign keeps its own date and time** — a 1991 Desert Storm turn or a 2027 Marianas turn takes today's sky without being dragged to today's date. The station is picked for you (the field you are flying from if it reports, otherwise the nearest one on the map that does), or set it by ICAO. If ATMOS-X is not installed, the network is down or nothing is reported, the turn quietly keeps the weather Retribution generated. Needs the **ATMOS-X** mod and its CLI. Adopted from upstream [#927](https://github.com/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution/pull/927).
* **[Mission Generation]** **Cloud presets: pick the weather mod you actually have.** The old **Use Bandit's clouds** checkbox only knew one community cloud pack, and that pack has been superseded — so anyone running a newer one had a tickbox that loaded the wrong presets. It is now a **Custom cloud preset pack** dropdown (**Mission Generation → Weather**) offering **None (stock DCS presets)**, **Bandit's Cloud Presets**, **Weather 2.0 (Bandit)** and **ATMOS-X**: pick whichever you have installed in DCS and the mission generator can use its presets. Only one can ever be active, because the packs reuse the same preset slots for different clouds — switching packs now ejects the previous one instead of layering on top of it. A save that had Bandit's clouds ticked keeps them. Adopted from upstream [#927](https://github.com/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution/pull/927).
* **[Air Doctrine]** **The auto-planner stops spending your whole air force on CAP.** On a theater with more exposed objectives than fighters, BARCAP was planned first and took every airframe, so each strike, SEAD, DEAD and anti-ship package that came later found no fighter free for its mandatory escort and was **scrubbed** — producing an ATO that was 100% defensive while a dozen strike squadrons sat on the ramp. Modern doctrine now holds a small **strike-escort reserve** (8 airframes) back from BARCAP volume, exactly as the Vietnam era already did; the least-threatened bases give up CAP rounds first and never drop below one round each. Measured on the new Marianas campaign, whose four fleet objectives each demand double CAP: 26 packages of which 22 were BARCAP and **2 offensive flights** became 27 packages, 14 BARCAP and **25 offensive flights** — the same wing, 74 aircraft tasked before and 143 after. Cold War and WWII doctrines are unchanged. NEW game required (doctrine is stored in the save).
* **[Mission Generation]** **One unreadable mod payload file no longer costs an aircraft all its loadouts.** Some mods (the CJS Super Hornet pack among them) write their payload files in a Lua style pydcs cannot parse. That error escaped into whoever first asked for a loadout — which could **abort an entire turn's mission planning** — and, more quietly, it stopped the payload scan partway through, *before* Retribution's own bundled loadouts were reached. The measured cost: the **F/A-18F and EA-18G had zero loadouts** and the F/A-18E only two, despite thirteen apiece being shipped with the app, so those jets planned and flew with whatever was left. Unreadable files are now skipped with a warning and the scan continues, restoring all 13 / 13 / 4 fits. Affects any aircraft whose mod ships payloads in that style.
* **[Campaigns]** **Marianas 2027: the wing can now reach the fight.** The campaign shipped with the stock 150 NM mission-range cap, but Guam to the top of the chain is 421 NM — so the northern half of the PLA order of battle was not merely unattacked, it was **unreachable**, rejected before a target was ever considered. The campaign now authors a 400 NM cap and holds each CAP station for the full mission (one wave instead of two), which together with the escort-reserve fix above is what turns the opening turn from a purely defensive posture into a real air campaign. NEW game required.
* **[Campaigns]** **Dropped the CH Arleigh Burke Flight III from every blue faction.** The mod ships it with a **351 NM** detection *and* engagement range — more than twice any other destroyer in the pack, and enough for a single hull to blanket an entire theater with a threat ring, which distorts threat maps and mission planning for both sides. The Flight IIA (160 NM, the realistic figure) remains available and is what US, NATO and coalition fleets now field. NEW game required.
* **[Campaigns]** **New campaign: Marianas — Second Island Chain (2027).** The modern-day China fight, on the one DCS map that needs no fiction to host it: Guam *is* the Second Island Chain, and Andersen AFB is the target set the PLA Rocket Force was built around. A Taiwan crisis went kinetic; the opening salvo cratered Guam's ramps while amphibious groups took Rota, Tinian and Saipan. Guam held — now hold the ramp you have left and fight north up the chain to the Marine detachment still cut off on Farallon de Pajaros. **Road-mobile PLARF launchers shoot and scoot between recon passes**, so a site is never quite where the last photo froze it and every strike starts with finding it again; three PLAN carrier groups and a Badger regiment contest the sea, both fleets trading **cruise missiles from finite magazines that never rearm**; and sea shipments sail a coastal-battery gauntlet as multi-hull convoys you can bleed a few ships at a time. The islands aren't connected, so **no ground front ever forms** — islands change hands by **air assault**, off the LHA by helicopter or by C-130J paradrop. Blue flies a modern joint wing: F-15Es, Vipers and B-1Bs out of Andersen's big ramp, and a carrier air wing of **Super Hornets with a Growler electronic-attack det** jamming ahead of the strike packages — plus a legacy Hornet squadron kept aboard on purpose, so a pilot without the Super Hornet mod is never locked out of a carrier jet. Guam runs **both a boom and a drogue tanker**, because the bombers and the jets off the boat don't refuel the same way. Fuzzle's original *Pacific Repartee* is untouched and still there. Needs the **Chinese Military Assets Pack** and the **CJS Super Hornet** mod (both arrive pre-ticked). NEW game required.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Ship groups are task groups now, not four copies of one hull.** Every naval objective generated as N identical ships — four Arleigh Burkes ringing the carrier, two identical corvettes as a "naval group" — no matter how many classes the navy actually fielded, because a group picked **one** ship type and stamped it into every position. A group now gets a **type per position**: a US carrier screen comes out as Burkes with a Perry and a Ticonderoga, a PLAN group mixes Type 052B/052C/054A. The mix stays sensible rather than random — extra hulls are only drawn from the lead ship's own family (frigates, destroyers and cruisers screen together; **a patrol boat never joins a cruiser's screen, submarines pair with submarines, and a carrier is never doubled up**), and no group fields more than three classes, so you get a task group and not one of everything. A navy that genuinely only fields one hull of a class still generates the same coherent group it always did. The **carrier and LHA screens** were also opened up to every surface combatant (they were declared destroyers-only, which both forced the uniform look and locked the layout out of frigate-only navies), with the "frigate escort" variants kept as a deliberate lighter screen. Buying a group from a base's menu is unchanged — you still get exactly the hull you picked — and SAM sites, EWRs and armor groups are untouched. NEW game required (composition is decided when the campaign is generated).
* **[Mission Generation]** **The CJS Super Hornets get a data cartridge too.** Every player **F/A-18E, F/A-18F and EA-18G** now spawns with the mission already in the jet — comm presets named to match your kneeboard, the route with push times and ETAs, and the boat's TACAN/ICLS/ACLS pre-tuned — the same auto-loading cartridge the stock Hornet and Viper have had, because the mod ships its own cartridge support. One deliberate difference: these jets get **no SA picture** — no FLOT, no friendly CAP/tanker racetracks and no enemy threat rings — because the mod's cartridge format has nowhere to put one, so those sections are skipped rather than written somewhere the jet can't read them (the DTC tab's three SA switches simply do nothing on these airframes, and a flight with *only* those ticked gets no cartridge instead of an empty one). The Super Hornet tanker variants get none — the mod ships no cartridge support for them.
* **[Plugins]** **Fixed the BigEye EWR sensor toggles doing nothing.** The BigEye EWR plugin's *BLUE/RED has datalink / RWR / IRST* options were wired to the config but never reached the radar-picture engine — the picture was always built from visual + radar only, so ticking "BLUE has datalink" (or RWR, or IRST) changed nothing for either coalition. The plugin now applies those sensor choices when the mission loads, so a datalink-equipped coalition gets the fuller, networked picture the option promises. Only affects the (default-off) BigEye EWR plugin.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Your front-line JTAC is back.** Retribution's standard JTAC — a FAC orbiting the front line, lasing for your CAS runs — had been replaced fork-wide by a drone that flies inside your air-to-ground packages. That drone was built for the COIN campaigns, where it genuinely is the better model (Enduring Resolve has no front line at all, and Inherent Resolve's war is fought at the strongholds and in Mosul rather than along its one Highway-1 front, so a FAC orbiting the FLOT would circle empty ground for the entire campaign) — but it shipped everywhere, so every ordinary campaign lost the JTAC it should have had. The front-line JTAC is now restored and is **the default again for every campaign**, and the packaged drone is opt-in per campaign via the new `COIN packaged drone JTAC` setting (**Campaign Management → Insurgency**, default **off**, needs COIN replenishment on). The two are mutually exclusive by design — running both would double-laze the same targets and list two JTACs on your kneeboard. The two COIN campaigns turn it on for you; nothing else does. Related: the drone squadron that used to be **auto-added to every modern campaign's air wing** (`Auto-field a JTAC drone squadron`, which has moved to the same Insurgency section) now only appears on campaigns actually flying the COIN drone JTAC, so a campaign you didn't expect to have a Reaper no longer quietly gains one. NEW game required.
* **[UI]** **Fixed SAM sites that drew a threat ring with nothing at the centre.** If you ever unticked **Air defences** in the map layers panel, every air-defense site lost its map icon — *and* so did its "suspected activity" circle — while **Enemy SAM threat range** kept drawing the rings, because those are separate layers. The result looked like broken fog of war: a ring around empty ground that you could only identify by hovering it (on one save, 54 sites and 25 suspected-activity circles were invisible this way). Reveal fog of war itself was working correctly the whole time. The **LORAD / MERAD / SHORAD / AAA** rows are now **filters of the "Air defences" master** rather than four more layers: switch the master off and the four rows **grey out** so it's clear where the icons went; switch it on with none ticked and you get every class; tick some and you get only those. This also fixes air-defense sites drawing **two stacked icons** (and two tooltips) when the master and a class row were both ticked. If the panel was your problem, tick **Air defences** once — the choice is remembered in the campaign save.
* **[Campaigns]** **Three authored factories that never existed are back.** The campaign loader read factory markers from only one authoring block (and SAM/ship/missile markers from only the other — the same class of bug fixed for markers earlier this cycle), so a factory placed in the "wrong" block silently never generated: **The Tblisi Gap**, **Retake the Falklands**, and **Operation Allied Sword** each shipped one such factory, now restored as a real strike target at the enemy base it was authored beside. The rule is now total — every object class loads from **either** authoring block, so campaign authors no longer have to memorize which block each marker type demands. NEW game required to see the restored factories.
* **[UI]** **Set a loadout once and every future flight of that aircraft and task gets it.** Build the fit you want in *Edit flight → Payload* and hit the new **Set as default for &lt;task&gt;** — from then on every F-4E planned as CAS (or whatever airframe and task you're looking at) is generated carrying it, and **Clear default** hands the slot back to Retribution's built-in fit. This was always technically possible — a payload saved under the exact name the planner looks up would override the shipped one — but nothing told you that, and the Save Payload box pre-fills a name (`Custom CAS`) that the planner *never* reads, so the obvious action produced a preset that did nothing. The scope is spelled out before you commit, because it is wide: it applies to **both sides**, in **every campaign**, until you clear it, and only to **newly planned** flights. Your own hand-made Mission Editor payloads in the same file are never touched, and the file is backed up before the first change. The same panel already remembered your fuel and cockpit settings per airframe.
* **[UI]** The **Payload tab** got a cleanup pass. The laser-code rows now **disappear when the loadout has no use for a code** — a Phantom carrying Snakeyes and Rockeyes is no longer shown an "Assigned TGP laser code" row, while the stock Pave Spike + GBU-12 fit still gets one. With *Use custom loadout* ticked, the Loadout box now says **(customised)** instead of silently reading like the stock preset is loaded. The **fuel figure in the spinner and the fuel-plan line below it finally agree** (they could differ by a pound or two). Long store names that get cut off show the full name **on hover**. Saving over an existing payload name **replaces** it in the dropdown instead of adding a duplicate. Stepping through flight members can no longer overwrite a member's custom loadout. And the Edit Flight window **names the flight in its title bar**, so a stack of them is navigable. Also fixed: the weapon laser-code dropdown was meant to be disabled for AI but never actually was, and wrongly claimed "AI does not use laser codes" — AI *does* need a weapon code to drop LGBs on a JTAC's designation, so the dropdown stays available and the false label is gone.
* **[Campaigns]** **The S-3 Viking stops flying the A-6's missions.** The Viking's mission weights out-ranked the A-6E Intruder on *every* land-attack task (BAI 690 vs 675, Strike 480 vs 440, OCA 510 vs 480), so any carrier air wing that fielded both sent the **anti-submarine aircraft** on the **bomber's** strike missions while the Intruder sat on deck. The S-3B is now **sea control only** — it flies **Anti-ship** and nothing else, and it now out-ranks every carrier fast jet for that role, so a Harpoon shot draws the dedicated platform instead of a Hornet. Strike work went back to the **A-6E Intruder**, and carrier tanking to the **A-6E buddy tanker** (the KA-6D store), across 23 factions and 39 campaigns; carrier decks keep a small 4-6 aircraft Viking anti-ship detachment. Also fixes two silent bugs this turned up: Grabthar's Hammer had **16 Vikings assigned to DEAD**, a mission the airframe cannot fly (a squadron whose aircraft can't do its job never flies at all), and five modern factions' only carrier tanker was the **mod-gated** Super Hornet tanker — with the mod off they had no carrier gas whatsoever. NEW game required.
* **[Kneeboards]** **Recon kneeboard pages are ~6x smaller — and so is every mission.** The target-recon pages draw satellite imagery, but were being saved as PNG — a lossless format meant for text and line art — at ~1.2 MB per page. With recon pages switched on they were **~90% of the entire mission file**: 16.5 MB of a fully-crewed 22 MB event mission, re-downloaded by every pilot and re-loaded by the server every single turn. They are now saved as JPEG, the same format DCS's own campaigns use for their imagery pages (a scan of 2,945 shipped missions found 7,971 JPEG kneeboard pages to 2,542 PNG). A fully-crewed mission drops from **22.4 MB to 9.0 MB — 60% smaller, with nothing removed** and no visible difference on the page. Text pages are untouched (PNG is the right format there). Only affects campaigns running "Generate target recon kneeboard pages".
* **[Mission Generation]** **Every generated mission is now archived**, so the one you flew is still there next week. Retribution still writes each turn to `retribution_nextturn.miz` and you load it exactly as you always have — but a named, dated copy now *also* lands in `Missions/Retribution Archive/` (e.g. `germany_1980_red_tide_turn03_20260716-193205.miz`). DCS's own mission browser lists that folder, so a past turn re-opens straight from the game when you want to see what actually spawned, and hosts no longer have to hand-copy the miz to a named file before every event. Re-planning and generating a turn again keeps **both** copies instead of overwriting the one that was flown. The newest 20 are kept; anything you put in that folder yourself is never touched.
* **[Plugins]** Cruise missile auto raids now launch **staggered inside a random window** (default 240–900 s after mission start, both ends tunable in the plugin options) instead of one mass volley at exactly 240 s — the same stagger the SCUD fire tasks use, so campaigns with several launching naval groups (or groups on both sides) don't stack every salvo's missile count against the framerate, and the defender's LAUNCH WARNINGs arrive per raid. The old single-delay option is still honored as the window's opening edge.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Warships fire real cruise missile raids.** A Burke's Tomahawks (or the enemy's Kalibr ships, with the CurrentHill packs) finally do their job: put an F10 map marker on a shore target and call **F10 → Cruise Missile Strike** to ripple a salvo from the nearest capable ship (type just a number in the marker's text — `6` or `#6` — to fire exactly that many) — or turn on auto raids and each side commits one salvo a turn at its best reachable target (command bunkers and comms first, then war industry), announced to the defender only as a bare **LAUNCH WARNING**. The missiles are real weapons from real, sinkable ships: kills count at debrief, point-defense SAMs (Tor, Pantsir, your Patriots) get to intercept them, and every ship carries a **finite campaign magazine with no rearm** ("Magazine status" on the same F10 menu shows what's left) — a salvo spent on a truck park is a salvo you won't have for the command bunker. New settings `Ship-launched cruise missile strikes` + `Auto-plan cruise missile raids` (**Mission Generation → Naval strike**, both default **off**; keep the new `Cruise missile strikes` plugin enabled).
* **[Settings]** Era-gated **cockpit options** now have their **own toggle** — `Restrict aircraft options by campaign date` (Difficulty & Realism, next to the weapons restriction) — so you can enforce weapons, cockpit options, or both. Previously the helmet gate rode the weapons toggle; if your save relied on that, flip the new setting once. The gate also grew per-airframe data: alongside JHMCS (F/A-18C, F-16C · 2003) it now covers the A-10C II's **Scorpion HMCS** (2012) and the MiG-29's **HMS** helmet sight (1983) — hidden from the payload dropdown and clamped to the period-correct visor in the generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Reverted: flights carry identical loadouts again.** An interim rolling build mixed old and new stock across a jet's weapon stations, so a Hornet could come out with a couple of AIM-120s and a couple of Sparrows and no two flights were loaded quite alike. It was flown once and dropped: the objection was that **turn 1 arrives already downgraded**, and the feature had no third setting left to try — it had already shipped both the fully-supplied opening (which left every flight identical, the thing it was built to fix) and the mixed one. Loadouts are back to what they were, the `Mix old and new stock in loadouts` setting is gone, and an existing save loads fine and simply ignores it. If you ran an interim build and liked it, say so — the ladder-walking machinery is documented well enough to rebuild.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The Raptor stops flying hypersonics, and the F-22A/Super Hornet's modern missiles are era-gated.** Two related changes. First, **the AIM-260A is now blue's top-end air-to-air missile**: the F-22A mod's own loadouts put **two Mako hypersonic missiles in all six** of the Raptor's air-to-air fits, which is a bigger stick than this fork wants to hand out — those two stations now carry the AIM-260A instead, so no planned loadout in any campaign frags a hypersonic (it stays available in the payload editor if you want it). Second, the AIM-120D, AIM-260A, Block II Sidewinder and Mako stores had **no entry in Retribution's weapon date data**, and a weapon that isn't listed is treated as **available in every era with no fallback** — so with *Restrict weapons by campaign date* on, an F-22A in a **2006** campaign was flying ungated AMRAAM-Ds and hypersonics. All four now sit on a proper ladder (AIM-120C → AIM-120D → AIM-260A → Mako) and step down properly: in the six shipped pre-2019 campaigns that field these mods — Clash of the Titans, Operation Vectron's Claw, Red Sea Rising, The Anvil of War, Exercise Vegas Nerve and Operation Desert Aladeen — the Raptor now flies period-correct AIM-9Ms and AIM-120Bs, while **Baltic Fury and Marianas 2027 get AIM-9X, AIM-120D and AIM-260A**. Nothing changes unless you play with weapons-by-date enabled.
* **[Campaigns]** **The enemy's supply roads got the same treatment.** Nine campaigns had no road between two enemy bases, so the enemy side of the ambient convoys — the columns you hunt with Armed Recon/BAI — silently never existed there. A red corridor pass traced their real highways too: the Aleppo belt (Aleppo Insurgency, Battle for Syria North — which also gets its Turkish FOB supply line), the Iranian Bandar Abbas–Kerman/Shiraz–Bushehr mainland highways (both Noisy Crickets), Cyprus's motorways (Aegean Aegis), the Calais coastal roads (Operation Dynamo), the full Enduring-Resolve ratline for Operation Shattered Dagger, Saipan's Middle Road and Tinian's Broadway (Velvet Thunder — enemy convoys now run per island), and Guam's Marine Corps Drive for Pacific Repartee. Every campaign now runs at least one side's convoys unless its map genuinely has no two same-side land bases. NEW game required.
* **[Campaigns]** **21 more campaigns got their supply roads.** The ambient-convoy/ambush layer needs a road between two friendly bases, and most campaigns never authored one — so a corridor-authoring pass traced the **real highways** (by real-world lat/lon, following the driveable-corridor standard) and gave a blue rear corridor to: TblisiGap and Vectron's Claw (the Kakheti Highway), Battle4Georgia and Kutaisi2Vaziani (west Georgia's E60/S2), Slava Ukraini (Anapa–Novorossiysk), The Long Road to H3 / Syria Full Map / Aleppo Insurgency / Battle4SyriaNorth (the Turkish O-52 and E91), Task Force Thunder (the H4–H3 pipeline highway), Battle4Area51 (US-95), Noisy Cricket ×2 and Scenic Merge (the UAE E11), Operation Gazelle (Israel's route 40), Red Sea Rising (route 40 + the Egyptian Delta), Desert Aladeen (the Baghdad ring), Shattered Dagger (Highway 1, Kandahar–Bastion), Velvet Thunder (Guam's Marine Corps Drive), Final Countdown 2 (the New Forest A-roads), and The Anvil of War (the Swedish/Norwegian E10/E45/E6 chain). **48 of the 67 campaigns** now run convoys; the rest are island/sea-split maps with no road to author. NEW game required to see the roads.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The roads have traffic now.** Every turn, each side's supply-convoy flow is topped up to a small **randomized** number of real columns on its own road network — some sharing a road, some spread out, never a forced count — so every mission on a road-bearing map has convoys to see, hunt, and protect on both sides. Enemy columns are ordinary Armed Recon/BAI targets; every column is a real, tracked transfer whose losses count at debrief. New setting `Ambient supply convoys` (**Mission Generation**, default **on**; a map with no roads between friendly bases simply gets none).
* **[Mission Generation]** Your own supply convoys **might get ambushed** — and nothing warns you beforehand. Sometimes (a chance roll, never a certainty) hidden enemy ambush teams dig in along a friendly convoy's route: one contact, or a gauntlet of five or six down the same road. The convoy looks like any other friendly convoy, **no objective or escort package shows anywhere in the UI**, and the first sign of trouble is the **TROOPS IN CONTACT** call (plus an F10 mark at the fight) when an ambush springs mid-mission — fly to the column's aid and clear the ambushers, or let it fight through alone; your call. Both sides are real, tracked units: a ground-down column is reinforcements that never arrive, and dead ambushers are a real enemy ground loss at debrief. New setting `Friendly convoy ambushes` (**Mission Generation**, default **on** — keep the `Convoy ambush` plugin enabled; the COIN campaigns, 1968 Yankee Station, and Red Tide force it on over saved defaults).
* **[Campaign]** The campaign now runs on **one continuous clock**. Instead of every turn jumping to a random hour of the day and re-rolling the weather from scratch, the mission clock **marches forward a few hours per turn** from the campaign's start date, the date **rolls over at midnight** (not once every four turns), and the **weather evolves from the turn before** — fronts roll in and clear over several turns instead of a thunderstorm one sortie and clear skies the next. Time of day and weather now read as one believable timeline that moves in step with the campaign phases. New setting `Continuous time & weather` (**Campaign Management**, default **on**; requires day-and-night missions — the day-only / night-only mission-time settings keep the old per-turn behaviour). Turn it off for the stock per-turn clock and random weather.
* **[Campaign Layer]** 1968 Yankee Station's political-will economy now has a **real clock**. The Vietnam defaults left both meters passively *rising*, so the narrated race — "break Hanoi before Washington's patience runs out" — had no time pressure: a careful player was never on a timer and effectively couldn't lose by will, and the will-coupled ROE escalation almost never fired. Washington's patience now **erodes with the war's duration** (war weariness, offset by winning the air battle and compounded by losses), and Hanoi's resolve is no longer near-unbreakable, so **sustained trail interdiction genuinely strangles the regime** and the bombing halt's "just wait it out" finally costs you leverage. The result is a genuine three-way race: strangle the trail fast and Hanoi folds early; fly it clean and you ride the full Rolling Thunder → Linebacker II arc to a negotiated win; flounder and Washington orders the withdrawal. And **Hanoi's counter-moves are now legible** — when the enemy answers the arc (surging the Ho Chi Minh Trail during the halt, opening a Tet/Easter ground offensive under Linebacker), you get a "Hanoi's response" briefing instead of only feeling the levers. Per-campaign tuning; Velvet Thunder and Red Flag 81-2 are unchanged.
* **[Campaigns]** The three Caucasus Vietnam campaigns are **consolidated into one** — **1968 Yankee Station** now carries the whole in-country air war in its scenario, and the standalone **Khe Sanh: Operation Niagara** and **Steel Tiger: Trail Interdiction** are dropped. Nothing is lost: the **Steel Tiger** trail war folds in as an armed-recon/BAI order-of-battle tilt (Navy Intruders, Skyraiders and Broncos hunting the Ho Chi Minh Trail), and the **Niagara** siege folds in as the DMZ front — a depleted Da Nang starts the line pressed in near the wire, the forward strips draw rocket/mortar harassment, and the encircled FOB Khe Sanh lives on the Super Gaggle resupply. The order of battle was also **rebalanced** to a leaner ~3:1 (BLUE ~116 / RED ~40 airframes) so it plays as a tense will-economy fight instead of a turkey shoot: blue's income trimmed and the enemy given a real trail war chest, every base sized to fit its parking (so "squadrons start full" fields the whole wing), and the off-map Guam B-52 base folded into U-Tapao (Maykop). NEW game required.
* **[Aircraft]** Fixed two squadron liveries that pointed at personal **Saved-Games-only** skins (they rendered as a default/wrong skin for anyone without the custom pack, e.g. on a server): the UH-1H and the C-130J-30 now use real in-game liveries (**US ARMY 1972** and **USAF Air Mobility Command**). The C-130J one was the *only* C-130J-30 squadron definition, so this corrects the transport's livery across every campaign.
* **[Campaigns]** COIN now has **dispersed cells**: the insurgency operates out in the countryside between the strongholds, not just in them. Small recon-fogged cells appear in the open field — **patrol for them** (TARPS + CAS), don't just hit known positions. A cell you leave alone matures and slips into its home stronghold, bringing a **destroyed ammo cache back into operation** — re-opening the regeneration you worked to shut off (or reinforcing the garrison if no cache is down). Hunting the field cells is how you *keep* a stronghold starved. New setting `COIN dispersed cells` (default off, preseeded on in Operation Enduring Resolve; requires COIN replenishment on).
* **[Campaigns]** COIN now has a **high-value-target hunt**: a named insurgent leader periodically surfaces near a stronghold for a **limited strike window** — a real recon-fogged target. Kill him inside the window and you deal the insurgency's momentum a real blow — but he often shelters among his people (a stronghold on a population-center ring), so the strike carries the **collateral-damage dilemma the rings price**: take the shot dirty (a momentum blow *and* a mandate-draining ROE violation), wait for a clean one, or let the window close. New setting `COIN high-value targets` (default off, preseeded on in Operation Enduring Resolve; requires COIN replenishment on) with a campaign-priced `red_hvt_killed` will weight.
* **[Campaigns]** COIN now has **roadside IEDs**: the insurgent supply roads (the ratline) are mined. Hidden IED emplacements appear on the trail — ordinary recon-fogged targets you must **find (TARPS/ISR) and strike (CAS/Armed Recon)** within a few turns. An IED you clear costs the insurgency nothing but the device; one you leave un-swept **detonates on the coalition and drains your mandate**. Sweeping the trail is a real job now — the political price of an un-secured road. New setting `COIN roadside IEDs` (default off, preseeded on in Operation Enduring Resolve; requires COIN replenishment on) with a campaign-priced `blue_ied_detonation` will weight.
* **[Campaigns]** COIN now has **re-infiltration**: the insurgency can **retake ground you cleared but did not hold**. An under-garrisoned base near a healthy stronghold draws a staged, announced pipeline over ~4 turns — first an infiltration cell appears, then a supply cache, then the base changes hands — each stage a real unit on the map you can strike to stop it. Garrison the base, kill the cell or cache, or strangle the source stronghold's caches to break the attempt. Total insurgent bases never exceed the campaign start (relocate, never grow), and a completed flip drains your **mandate** like any lost base. Clearing a stronghold is no longer enough — you have to *hold* it. New setting `COIN re-infiltration` (default off, preseeded on in Operation Enduring Resolve; requires COIN replenishment on).
* **[Kneeboard]** Fixed kneeboard content **clipping off the right edge**. Wide tables (the Comms & Coordination support ladders when a package is on three radio channels) now **wrap the over-wide column to fit the page** instead of running the FREQ / Departure / TOT columns off the edge, the package FREQ/TOT header line splits when it would overrun, and the enemy-AD threat **bullseye cue lists truncate to the page width** (with a "…" or "+N") instead of being cut mid-number. Narrow tables that already fit are untouched.
* **[Kneeboard]** The compact deck's **Threats & Targets** page no longer leaves its lower half blank when the enemy air defenses are still unidentified. When the target-recon photo takes the flex page (which drops the Fuel Ladder from the deck), the **Fuel Ladder now backfills that blank space** below the threat cards — so on a fogged-threat turn you get the ladder instead of empty page, and a page full of identified threats simply omits it.
* **[Planner]** New **long-range carrier ops** (`long_range_carrier_ops`, default off): when the carrier stands off far beyond the auto-planner's reach (Enduring Resolve parks it ~800 km out in the Gulf of Oman, the real OEF cycle), the stock range gate left the whole air wing on the deck. The campaign now raises the airplane range gate so the carrier Hornets join the wider war, and frags one deterministic **carrier strike package each turn** from the boat's own squadrons — a Hornet strike section, an A-6 tanker, and an E-2 on AEW&C — built through the engine's own package planner. The boat's **other** carrier flights (the SEAD Sweep/Escort Hornets the commander frags in their own packages) now **tank from that same A-6**: a post-planning pass pins their refuel point onto the A-6's held orbit — which sits right on their launch/recovery route — instead of the dry far-end refuel point the stock planner gave them. Preseeded on in Operation Enduring Resolve; other campaigns are untouched.
* **[Campaigns]** Enduring Resolve's supply lines now **follow the roads you'd actually drive** — Highway 1 (the Ring Road) out to Farah, Route 611 up the Helmand River valley (Gereshk → Sangin → Kajaki), and the Uruzgan mountain road (Kandahar → Tarin Kowt) — instead of straight lines across the ridgelines. Traced from the real Afghan road network (the DCS Afghanistan map is real-world-coordinate) via a new authoring helper, `tools/supply_route_geo.py`. This is now the **RetLab standard for every supply-line drawing**: trace the corridor you'd travel between the two points; the route still binds to the same bases (only its endpoints matter), the shape in between just follows the real road.
* **[Campaigns]** The corridor standard now reaches the built campaigns. **Red Flag 81-2's** supply routes are re-traced onto the **real NTTR road network** — US-95 out of Las Vegas (Nellis → Indian Springs → Camp Mercury), US-6 east out of Tonopah, and the Gold Flat / Kawich valley down to Pahute Mesa. The one line that genuinely cut country — the "US-95 west corridor" from the Tonopah Test Range to Beatty, which used to run straight down the Kawich Range — now doglegs the real way: **west to Goldfield, then south through Scotty's Junction**. **Yankee Station / Steel Tiger** (the shared Vietnam-on-Caucasus trail) get their worst offenders cleaned up too: the Senaki → Thanh Hoa line is no longer a bare straight shot across the Kolkheti plain, and the Ban Laboy trail legs no longer detour ~25 km east into the lowland and back. Every endpoint is untouched, so all routes still bind the same bases (engine-verified). `tools/supply_route_geo.py` is now multi-campaign (`coin`, `red_flag_81_2`, the Caucasus trail fixes). Red Tide (Germany) was already traced on the autobahns and is left as-is.
* **[Campaigns]** Enduring Resolve gets the **2006 OEF air war**: a new multi-national **OEF Coalition 2006** faction — **Dutch F-16s (322 Squadron) and RAF Harriers (IV (AC) Squadron) on the Kandahar ramp** beside the A-10s, Marine Harriers at Bastion, **carrier Hornets (VFA-113) and an E-2 flying from a REAL carrier in the Gulf of Oman** (the map has water — a user-proven placement; ~780 km cycles up the drawn safe corridor), and the **CENTAF heavies — Strike Eagles (391st FS), B-1s, and KC-135s — home-based at Kandahar** (the coalition airhead's long runway; no floating off-map spawn base), each squadron under its own nation's flag and voice. A new **COIN doctrine** (faction key `coin`) lets the coalition strike through gun/IR threat — against an enemy with no radar SAMs the stock suppress-first rule deadlocked every strike (0 legal targets in the probe), and there is nothing to SEAD. The insurgents answer with **ZU-23 sites at every stronghold, SHORAD at seven, and a light radar-SAM crust at the anchors** — an SA-6 battery over Farah, an SA-3 site at Tarinkot, a Kub at the Kandahar gate, SA-8/13/15 in the short-range mix (none inside the town rings, so SEAD/DEAD stays AI-playable) — enough to make SEAD a real job again, never enough to stop the war. The Navy tanks itself: **VA-165 A-6E buddy tankers** embark alongside the Hornets and the Hawkeye. NEW game required.
* **[Campaigns]** Enduring Resolve draws **the horror of COIN onto the map** as four big **positive-control valleys** — no-strike areas over the real populated river valleys of the 2006 campaign, drawn as two corridor lanes (the **Helmand green zone** Kajaki → Sangin → Gereshk → Lashkar Gah → Marjah; the **Musa Qala** Route-611 feeder Now Zad → Musa Qala → Kajaki) and two boxes (the **Tarin Kowt** bowl and the **Delaram** junction). The strongholds and much of the insurgency's cells and caches sit inside them, so every fixed strike near the people is **priced per kill** (the ROE violation weight drops 6.0 → 1.0: CDE pressure, not taboo — a careful town fight is survivable once, a carpet habit bleeds the mandate out). The open desert and the northern gate stay free; trail convoys and troops in contact are never gated and air assaults (captures) are never blocked, so you still retake your objectives — you just pay for the collateral when you fight where the insurgency hides. (This **replaces** the earlier 9-town-ring + invisible whole-map free-fire model with explicit, visible box/corridor no-strike zones.) NEW game required.
* **[UI]** ROE zones now **read as shaded areas, not thin lines** on the campaign map — the restricted/free-fire fill was bumped from a barely-there 6% to a legible 14%, so a large box or corridor shows its whole footprint over the satellite imagery instead of just a lone dashed edge. Enduring Resolve's four positive-control valleys were also **enlarged** (the Helmand and Musa Qala corridors widened, the Tarin Kowt and Delaram boxes grown ~3×) so they properly blanket the populated belt.
* **[Campaigns]** Enduring Resolve's **population-center ring now has teeth** (it was an empty circle — nothing inside to tempt you). **FOB Geronimo's ammo caches now hide inside Lashkar Gah** and the new Geronimo supply leg runs **through the town**: starve that stronghold or interdict its column in-town and the strike prices into the Coalition's mandate; the clean options (air-assault the FOB, catch the convoy in the open desert) cost more effort instead. The empty **Herat ring is cut** — a ROE ring must guard something. NEW game required.
* **[Campaigns]** Operation Enduring Resolve's **ratline is now real** (it was promised by the arc copy but nothing could run: the laydown had no supply routes, the trail picker required front lines, and the insurgent strongholds held no transferable stock). The campaign now authors **8 red-to-red supply corridors** (Farah and Tarinkot rear chains feeding the Helmand ring and the Kandahar gate — visible on the map), the §35 trail machinery orients toward the opposing bases when a campaign has no front lines, and on COIN campaigns the rear source is seeded with irregular kit (external support over the border) so a real, interdictable convoy is always flowing. Killing it is a real loss and a momentum drain.
* **[Factions]** **Toyota Al Gaib 2001** (the COIN insurgent faction) was missing most of the insurgent kit its sibling factions carry: it gains the four **DIM' Toyota technicals** (incl. the kamikaze truck), the **§41 HDS ERO ZU-23 family** (Toyota/armored technicals + open/closed emplacements + the ERO preset group — resolve only with the HDS mod, drop silently without it), and the **SA-9**. Deliberately still no armor — the 2006 insurgency stays light, and the COIN regen pool grows from 6 to 9 unit types. Operation Enduring Resolve now preseeds `high_digit_sams` so the ERO technicals actually appear.
* **[Campaigns]** New **Afghanistan - Operation Enduring Resolve (COIN)** — the first **living counterinsurgency campaign** (a fork of Starfire's Operation Shattered Dagger). The insurgency's 13 strongholds **regenerate**: cleared cells quietly come back toward their original strength each turn (and your last recon picture stands until you re-fly it — "we cleared that position last week; it's shooting again"), throttled by **hidden ammo caches** you can recon and strike; kill a stronghold's caches and its regeneration collapses to a trickle. The war is decided by the will meters — **the Coalition's mandate** (bleeds from airframes, lost bases, strikes near the Lashkar Gah/Herat population-center rings, and plain time) versus **the insurgency's momentum** (bleeds from caches, trail convoys, and strongholds — almost never from dead fighters). Three authored phases (Disrupt the Network → Clear and Hold → Break the Momentum), FOB standoff fire, and the supply-trail ratline round out the loop. The insurgent replenishment engine (`coin_insurgency`) is generic and default-off — any future COIN campaign can preseed it.
* **[Campaign Layer]** The **political-will economy is now campaign-generic**: the Washington-vs-Hanoi framing and every feed weight are just the *defaults* of a per-campaign **will profile**. A campaign YAML's `will:` block re-labels both meters and their exhaustion headlines (a Falklands can read "London recalls the task force") and re-weights every feed — plus a new **warship-loss feed** (`blue_ship_lost` / `red_ship_lost`), so naval wars bleed will from sunk ships the way Vietnam bleeds it from downed B-52s. The four Vietnam campaigns carry no block and play exactly as before; the authored labels follow through the per-turn will message, the map ribbon meters, the intel box, and the Stats chart.
* **[Campaigns]** The Vietnam-era campaigns (1968 Yankee Station, Velvet Thunder, Red Flag 81-2) now ship **`high_digit_sams: true`** and their laydowns carry **red EWR sites**, so the period **P-37 "Bar Lock"** the HDS faction pass added actually spawns — closing the "period red IADS has no early-warning net" gap in practice, not just in the faction files. New EWR markers: Hanoi + Vinh on the Yankee Station board, Saipan for Velvet Thunder (Red Flag 81-2 already had its two). **HDS Ultimate Compilation is now on the campaign Required-Mods lists.**
* **[Campaigns]** New **Nevada - Red Flag 81-2** campaign — the 1981 Red Flag exercise played as the war it rehearses (after the Reflected Simulations F-4E campaign the squadron flies). An F-4E wing detachment at Nellis fights the historically-real Red Force: 64th/65th **Aggressor F-5Es** on MiG-21 GCI hit-and-run doctrine, the **4477th "Red Eagles" Constant Peg MiGs out of Tonopah Test Range**, an **SA-2/SA-3 emulator array around Tolicha Peak**, AAA belts on the ingress corridors, and a simulated enemy army on a FEBA north of Camp Mercury. Ships with two new era factions (**USA Red Flag 1981** / **Red Force 1981 (Nellis Aggressors)**, wired to the Vietnam doctrines) and the full **Vietnam mechanics stack preseeded**: political will as the TAC exercise assessment, the static exercise FEBA, the Vietnam Ops battlefield suite (no naval gunfire — no sea), and a three-phase authored escalation arc (**Week One → Force on Force → Surge Week**) whose **Groom Lake box never releases** — enter it and the assessment bleeds, exactly like the real range.
* **[Mods]** High Digit SAMs support retargeted from the abandoned original mod (v1.4.0) to the actively-maintained **[Ultimate Compilation](https://github.com/dcs-sams/HighDigitSAMs-Ultimate-Compilation)** (v1.4.3+), behind the same New Game toggle. Absorbs the compilation's breaking changes (renamed S-300PS radars re-pointed everywhere; the dropped HDS KS-19/SON-9/SA-24 replaced by their vanilla equivalents) and registers its new content: **S-400/SA-21** and **S-300V4** batteries (new presets on the extended S-300 site), the **S-300PT** launcher, **Pantsir-SM** SHORAD, the **SAMP/T** Aster battery (new Patriot-geometry layout, wired to France), **SA-7/SA-7b manpads** for 70s–80s red factions, four new **EWRs** — including the **P-37 Bar Lock**, which closes the "period red faction has zero EWR units" IADS blind-net gap across 16 factions — and the ERO **ZU-23 Toyota technicals** for insurgents. Also fixes a silent gating bug where the mod-off strip matched display names instead of DCS type ids, so HDS manpads/C2 units were never actually removed when the mod was disabled.
* **[Campaigns]** Audited every bundled campaign and swapped aircraft from **cut mods** for in-game (or kept-mod) equivalents, so the stock campaigns generate cleanly on RetLab's trimmed mod set. Replacements honour each campaign's faction and era: e.g. CurrentHill **[CH] B-21 → B-1B Lancer**, Swedish **[CH] JAS-39C → F-16CM**, Ukrainian **[CH] MiG-29MU2 / Su-24MU / Su-27P1M → MiG-29S / Su-24M / Su-27**, **KC-130J → KC-135**, **UH-60L → UH-60A**, **F-111C → F-15E**, and the Vietnam-era *1968 Yankee Station* carrier wing rebuilt on period **F-8E Crusader / A-6E Intruder / A-1H Skyraider**. Kept mods (F-22A, EA-18G/Super Hornet, the CurrentHill Russian pack, Vietnam War Vessels) are untouched; the **[CH] B-21 is removed** from the blue factions per squadron preference, and the period **A-6E Intruder / F-100D Super Sabre** are added to the Vietnam faction so the carrier/strike slots resolve. Each campaign's mod toggles are set to match, and a handful of genuinely-broken aircraft references (e.g. `IL-78MD`, `Mi-8`, `E-3`) are fixed along the way.
* **[Factions]** Extended the cut-mod cleanup to the **faction definitions** (#267 had only swapped the campaigns): the same trimmed-mod-set swaps now apply across all faction JSONs — **UH-60L → UH-60A**, **KC-130J → KC-135**, the Ukrainian **[CH] MiG-29MU2 / Su-24MU / Su-27P1M → MiG-29S / Su-24M / Su-27**, and **F-111C → F-15E** (removed outright in the Vietnam-era USA faction). It's dedup-aware (the cut entry is dropped where the modern equivalent was already in the roster, rather than duplicated), the matching `liveries_overrides` keys move with the aircraft, and the Swedish **JAS-39 (+ AJS37 Viggen fallback)** is intentionally kept. A new test (`tests/test_faction_modernization.py`) fails CI if any cut-mod aircraft is re-introduced into a faction or campaign — the faction loader otherwise drops it silently, so the regression would be invisible.
* **[Mods]** Updated the bundled **Community A-4E-C** mod definition to **v2.3.0** (upstream PR #840) — refreshed weapon set plus the Shrike payload-rail CLSID fix (`AGM-45B → LAU-34_AGM-45B`) in the SEAD/anti-ship presets.
* **[SCAR]** Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance reworked to a **loiter-and-task** model: the flight holds over a **static kill box** and services a **real, static enemy armor target** (still hidden among look-alike decoys + clutter — the discrimination puzzle survives). Because the target is a real campaign unit, destroying it attrits the enemy through the normal loss/debrief path — no bespoke SCAR scoring. The commander-capture path is preserved and **inverted**: a purchased SOF team (C-130 airdrop) assaults the **held** command vehicle and takes the commander alive if you leave him intact (revealing enemy command posts next turn), with a stranded-SOF CSAR recovery loop and enemy command-post intel fog. The old moving/fleeing-target chase is retired. Default ON for new campaigns. *(The C-130 "King" on-scene-commander designation/talk-on is a follow-on phase.)*
* **[Combat SAR]** A new bespoke pilot-rescue flight type: a CH-47 orbits near the front as the rescuer while a C-130 flies the overhead HC-130 "King" on-scene-command orbit (lighting an air-tracking TACAN every rescue helo can home on, plus an F10 LARS survivor-locator). When a human pilot ejects, the MOOSE CSAR engine spawns them with a beacon and the helo recovers them — and delivering a downed pilot to a friendly field now **spares that aviator** in the campaign (you still lose the jet, but the experienced pilot returns to the squadron instead of being killed). The same Combat SAR helo can also **extract a stranded SCAR SOF team** in-mission (a botched commander-capture leaves a team behind): fly out, pick it up, deliver it home, and the team is recovered + refunded — an alternative to the dedicated CSAR air-assault sortie. The rescue helo is the player-flyable CH-47F with its door M60D gunners for self-protection (AI CH-47D stays as a fallback), and the King is the player-flyable C-130J-30. Player-flown, with an optional AI standing alert (`auto_combat_sar`, default OFF).
* **[Aircraft]** Consolidated the C-130 transport fleet onto the player-flyable C-130J-30 (Airplane Simulation Company module, which the DCS AI can also fly): the stock AI-only C-130 "ugly model" is retired and every faction now fields the C-130J-30 for transport / SOF airdrop / the Combat SAR King. The KC-130 / KC-130J aerial tankers are unchanged. In-progress campaigns with an old C-130 squadron migrate to the C-130J-30 automatically on load. (The dead Anubis Hercules mod is fully out of Retribution.)
* **[Mission Generation]** DEAD and SEAD flights against a ground target now get one waypoint per individual target (with coordinates, matching the kneeboard), and the SEAD/DEAD kneeboard target list gains an "STPT" column. AI plain-SEAD reworked to loiter at a standoff orbit and engage reactively, and AI DEAD flights receive the best available standoff/PGM loadout.
* **[Kneeboard]** New recon kneeboard pages — target reconnaissance, a friendly-packages coordination list, and a package-targets theater map. Basemap tiles are fetched once at mission generation and cached under Saved Games; on offline or locked-down networks the pages fall back automatically to an offline coastline basemap (the cache is safe to delete). Ships the per-terrain airport-imagery dataset (satellite-mosaic alignment, runway thresholds, DCS-accurate field elevations) so airfield diagrams line up and the ATIS block shows a temperature-corrected altimeter setting (QNH) with QFE reduced to the field — matching the in-sim ATIS.
* **[Plugins]** ATIS for player flights via a MOOSE voice-ATIS plugin (per-airfield frequencies and spoken reports). Self-documenting Lua plugin options with a label/doc pass across plugins.
* **[Map]** Carrier/LHA ship groups and blue non-carrier ships appear on the campaign map with their air-defense rings; hovering a SAM/detection ring highlights its emitter (and vice versa); enemy IADS links are coloured by kind and state.
* **[UX]** Bulk-set altitude across a flight's en-route waypoints and step the per-waypoint altitude editor by 1000 ft; configurable altitude scatter band and patrol floor. Improved fast-forward with combat-skip and a "Player at IP" stop condition.
* **[Planner]** Opt-in, per-side auto-planner target unpredictability — weighted-random reordering of opportunistic offensive targets so the enemy stops hitting the same things every turn (reactive threat response stays deterministic).
* **[Target Intel]** The Approximate target-location cue offset is tightened to 1-3 NM, so players still have to visually acquire but aren't sent hunting across the map.
* **[Plugins]** CTLD updated to ciribob 1.6.1.
* **[Cleanup]** Removed the upstream Pretense campaign generator (unused by RetLab fork).
* **[Cleanup]** Retired the `dismounts` plugin (a MIST-only, performance-heavy infantry-dismount script with no MOOSE successor, not registered in the active plugin list). First step of the MIST → MOOSE framework consolidation; old saves drop any orphaned `dismounts` plugin keys on load.
* **[Cleanup]** Retired the `ewrs` plugin (legacy MIST-based EWR threat-callout script), superseded by the MOOSE `Ops.INTEL`-based `bigeye` EWR. Part of the MIST → MOOSE consolidation; old saves drop any orphaned `ewrs` plugin keys on load.
* **[Cleanup]** Removed the unused `arty` (CG ArtySpotter) and `artymbot` (Mbot Call-Artillery) player fire-support scripts. Both had been silently dropped from the active plugin list during the QRA-reserve integration and never re-enabled; their directories are now deleted and old saves drop any orphaned `arty`/`artymbot` plugin keys on load.
* **[Cleanup]** Deleted dead resource files that still shipped in the build: six orphaned Pretense mission files (`*_full.miz` / `normandy_small.miz`, left behind when the Pretense generator and its campaign descriptors were removed) and two legacy root landmap pickles (`channellandmap.p`, `cau_groundobjects.p`, superseded by the per-theater `theaters/<name>/landmap.p`).
* **[Plugins]** New experimental MANTIS IADS engine (MOOSE-based, alternative to Skynet). Inert by default — only active when a campaign's IADS engine is set to MANTIS; core SAM/EWR networking + emissions control (pending in-game validation).

* **[UI]** **Cruise missile strikes are visible outside the F10 menu now.** The mission briefing gets a CRUISE MISSILES section — your side's tasked auto raid (count, shooter, target) and each launcher's remaining magazine, plus the marker call-for-fire how-to; the naval group's info dialog shows its remaining missiles (friendly ships only); and the debriefing window reports what was expended per ship group with the post-mission remainder. Enemy residual stock is never shown anywhere — the other side's LAUNCH WARNING stays their only cue.
* **[Modding]** Support for CJS Super Hornet Mod v2.4.5.260726. Verified against a fresh pydcs export taken with the mod loaded: the declared weapon set (702 stores), every store's name and weight, and each pylon's weapon list are unchanged from v2.4.5.260501.RC1, so no loadout is affected and existing saves need nothing. The update is confined to aircraft properties -- the F/A-18F gains a `WSO Cockpit Type (Visual Only)` option (Advanced or Legacy crew station), the E/A-18G's cosmetic Demo option loses its `Installed` value, the E/F/G gain a read-only cockpit-version label, and all five variants carry the new package version label.
* **[Modding]** **US Super Hornets were calling with Australia's callsigns.** The mod ships four callsign pools -- USA, Australia, Kuwait and USAF Aggressors -- but the extension carried a single pool holding the Australian names, so every US Rhino, Growler and tanker drew from `Brutal`, `Buckshot`, `Cannon` instead of `Hornet`, `Squid`, `Ragin`, and the other three nations had no pool at all. All four are now present and keyed the way pydcs looks them up (by country shortname, not display name -- a block copied straight out of an export resolves for USA alone and silently drops the rest, which a new test now catches). Player-visible: US flights get different callsigns from the next mission, an Australian squadron finally gets the Australian pool, and a Combined Joint Task Forces squadron -- which chains every pool -- now draws from 67 names rather than 16.

## Fixes
* **[Campaign]** **A SAM the campaign never named is in the IADS now.** A campaign with an `iads_config:` block only exported the sites the block named, so a SAM in an anonymous slot fought as a standalone DCS group: never dark, never cued, and bombing the power station beside it changed nothing. Sites the block does not name are enrolled after it and wired by range; the named sites keep exactly the connections the block gives them. An older save is repaired when it loads, and `IADS: wired …` in the log names the sites. Campaigns wired by range are unchanged.
* **[Mission Generation]** **`dcs.log` was still three-fifths one MOOSE line.** The 2026-08-29 fix for `Could not get EVENTMETA data for event ID=61` keyed the wrong event. Id 61 is a new DCS 2.9.29 event raised on every AI option change, which the front-line battle does about ten times a second. MOOSE now ignores it the way upstream does. Log volume only; nothing in-game changes, and it is not what causes stutter on a big front.
* **[UI]** **The Time & Weather dialog's wind boxes showed stale numbers and accepted speeds DCS cannot fly.** Two problems in the wind override. The speed boxes allowed up to 200 knots, but DCS models no more than 97 and the campaign's own wind generator has always clamped to that figure — so anything above it was written into the mission and silently ignored. Both now read the same ceiling, and so does live weather, where it matters more: a real jet stream at 26,000 ft beats 97 knots routinely, so a live-weather turn could print a wind on the kneeboard that the sim was never going to fly. Separately, accepting the dialog left the wind readout on the top panel showing the previous wind: the refresh that runs on accept updates the forecast, not the wind labels, and a wind-only edit triggers nothing else. The mission itself always got the wind you set — only the display lagged. Existing saves need nothing.
* **[Flight Planner]** **A SEAD jet's steerpoints listed the whole site, fuel trucks included.** Planning SEAD against a ground target built one target steerpoint per unit at the objective. Against a six-launcher SA-2 that is thirteen steerpoints, and six of them are the site's support section: two cargo trucks, two fuel bowsers and two ZU-23 guns. A SEAD flight orbits at standoff and shoots HARMs, so none of those is something it can be pointed at — and the list also handed over the site's exact composition and unit count, which is what the SEAD kneeboard page is written to withhold until you have engaged the site. **SEAD now gets one steerpoint per emitter** — the search and track radars, self-contained launch vehicles, radar-directed point defence, and the launchers those radars serve. **DEAD is unchanged**: it goes after individual launchers, so it still gets a steerpoint for every unit. A site with no identifiable emitter still gets the full list rather than an empty one, and mod air-defence units are recognised on the same terms as stock ones. Flight plans are saved, so a flight planned before this update keeps the steerpoints it already had until it is re-planned.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Three lines were 59% of `dcs.log`, and two of them were ours.** A seven-minute Afghanistan turn wrote 7,569 log lines and hid another 7,863 that DCS collapsed as duplicates. **6,807 of those were a single MOOSE error.** The bundled framework lists DCS's task-complete event in one table and not in the other, so every time DCS fired it -- about fourteen times a second with a front-line firefight running -- the event was thrown away and an error written instead. An archived Germany Cold War log has 11,861 of them. The missing entry is now there. Nothing in the generator listens for that event, so no behaviour changes; the point is that a log you open after a bad mission is now readable. **The second was the front-line firefight's own retry line** (846 in the same seven minutes), which fired whenever a ground unit made no progress and had to be re-tasked off-road. That is a recovery, not a fault, but the line named no unit -- so it could equally have been thirty units recovering twice or one unit wedged from minute two, and those want opposite fixes. It now prints the unit and a per-unit count. Behaviour is unchanged pending a measurement. **The third is not ours**: `INVALID ATC` is written by DCS during terrain load, before any mission exists, for helipads the map itself ships -- Syria alone throws between 144 and 724 of them per session.
* **[UI]** **Your payload backups made DCS log an error on every launch.** Setting a default loadout for a task backs the payload file up first, and that backup went into a folder inside `Saved Games/DCS/MissionEditor/UnitPayloads`. DCS reads that directory expecting nothing but payload files, so it tried to open the folder as one and failed -- twice, every time the game started. The backups now live in `Saved Games/DCS/Retribution/PayloadBackups`, alongside the other folders Retribution already keeps. **Backups you already have are moved for you** the next time you open a payload tab, and the old folder is removed once it is empty -- if it holds anything the app did not put there, that is left alone rather than deleted, and you can clear it by hand.
* **[Flight Planner]** **The C-130J could not be planned into a rescue at all, despite the app offering it.** The Hercules carries the CSAR task so a player can fly the HC-130 "King" on-scene commander role, and the README has said so since the rescue system was replaced. Picking a survivor, choosing the C-130J-30 and adding the flight failed on "Could not create flight: CSAR is only usable by helicopters" -- a guard written to stop the auto-planner fragging a King for a pickup no AI can complete, which also blocked the hand-fragged one it was never meant to touch. A fixed-wing CSAR flight now gets its own plan: a racetrack near the survivor, 15 nm off on the side away from the nearest threat, pushed outside any SAM ring the survivor is sitting in, and no pickup. Add it by hand -- right-click the survivor, add the rescue helicopter, then add a second flight on the C-130J-30. **The auto-planner still will not frag one**, for the original reason: DCS only lets helicopters land at an unprepared site, so an AI King would orbit a survivor it can never collect. Helicopter rescues are unchanged.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The target recon kneeboard printed what the map was concealing.** A site you have never engaged keeps its composition hidden -- the map shows a circle at a deliberately imprecise position and tells you nothing about what is inside or how far it shoots. The recon kneeboard pages read none of that: the detail page listed every unit's exact position, type and whether it was already destroyed, and the overview drew accurate threat and detection rings for every enemy site near your route, engaged or not. Both now follow the same rule as the map -- **engage a site and its card fills in; until then it stays blank.** An un-engaged site is left off the overview entirely rather than drawn without its rings, because this page cannot blur a position the way the map does. **Nothing you were entitled to has been taken away**, and a site your side has hit is unchanged. These pages are off by default (**Mission Generator -> Kneeboard -> "Generate target recon kneeboard pages"**), so this was not reaching anyone who had not turned them on.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The recon flight was the one aircraft in the package with no picture of its own target.** Target reconnaissance kneeboard pages -- the target overview, the numbered aimpoint list, threat rings and approach context -- are built for every flight whose sortie is about a specific piece of ground: strike, BAI, CAS, SEAD, DEAD, both OCA tasks, anti-ship and armed recon. TARPS was never in that list, so the photo bird flew out to image a site while carrying nothing that showed it, even though it rides in the same package and is pointed at the same target. It now gets the same pages, and its aimpoint list doubles as the shot list. This matters more after the 2026-08-26 DCS patch, which made the F-14's TARPS far cheaper to run, let the pilot work the cameras without a human RIO, and added a panoramic camera plus automatic unit marking on the developed photos. The pages are still behind **Mission Generator -> Kneeboard -> "Generate target recon kneeboard pages"**, off by default until the imagery alignment fix gets a flight.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A generated mission containing a carrier could not be opened again by any tool.** Retribution switches on the carrier's automatic landing system whenever it sets up Link 4, but the library that reads and writes mission files could write that setting and not read it back — so every generated `.miz` with a boat in it was, in effect, write-only, and anything that tried to re-open one failed outright. Nobody hit it in normal play because only tooling re-opens a generated mission, but it broke mission inspection, debugging and analysis for any campaign with a carrier. The library now reads the setting it has been writing since 2022, and a test refuses any future task that can be written but not read.
* **[Data]** **The 2026-08-26 DCS patch's new units and the F-4E's Shrike B are now in the generator.** The unit database moved to the updated game the same day the patch dropped, read from a full export of the updated install: the AGM-45B on all four of the F-4E's LAU-34 stations, the German tank-transporter set (SLT-50 tractor and trailer, HX81 tractor), the HX77 heavy truck, the BMP-3 ERA variant, the Stryker Dragoon and ZA-SpN Titan, and the S-75 reload trailer and fuel trucks. Two F-4E defects went with it: the pack's own Shrike B entry was overriding the reworked missile with year-old borrowed settings (the patch rebuilt that missile's flight model from scratch), and the wing-station gun pods had been quietly wired as the centreline variant since July -- both now resolve to the real thing. The post-update audit of every registered mod unit came back **430 for 430** against the fresh export, fixing four drifts on the way (datalink flags on the two CJS trainer Hornets, livery names on the two Ukraine-pack jets). **RetLab's F-4E weapons OVGME mod is still unapplied after the update** -- it needs rebasing onto the new game files before it goes back on, and until then the expanded fits stay off the jet in-game.
* **[Mission Generation]** **BMP-3s stopped firing like armour after the 2026-08-26 DCS patch.** That patch folded the CurrentHill assets pack into the core game, and its BMP-3 replaces the old one in place -- same unit, new model, but the name on it changed from `IFV BMP-3` to `IFV BMP-3 [CH]`. Troops In Contact looks its per-unit firing profiles up **by that name**, and a name it does not recognise falls back to the generic profile without an error, so the BMP-3's deliberately slowed single-shot rate reverted to the infantry-carrier rate -- BMP-3 groups poured fire like a BTR-80. The lookup now also tries the name with a trailing vendor tag stripped, so both spellings resolve and older DCS installs are unaffected. **Nothing else was at risk**: the unit id is unchanged, so no campaign, layout or unit file was ever affected, and only the BMP-3 collided -- the other four units Troops In Contact tunes by name are untouched. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Performance]** **"Distant ground AI sleeps until aircraft approach" cancelled the air-to-ground half of a mission, and is now off on every campaign.** A sleeping group has its DCS controller switched off, and an AI strike or SEAD flight cannot prosecute one -- the attack task finds no target from the ingress point, and the flight flies the rest of its route home loaded. Measured on the same campaign turn generated twice: with the sleep on, 12 of 13 air-to-ground packages turned 66-86 km short of any enemy ground unit and released nothing (0 Mk-82, 0 HARM, 10 enemy vehicles killed in 104 minutes); with it off, the same turn released 31 Mk-82 and 6 HARM and killed 23, in 41 minutes. Anti-radiation shots fail for the matching reason -- a sleeping gun site does not radiate, so a HARM has nothing to home on. The setting already defaulted off; **Marianas - Second Island Chain 2027** and **Operation Baltic Fury** preseeded it on and no longer do. Expect both to run heavier than they did -- turn on **Culling of distant units** if a mission stutters. The setting is still there, and both its descriptions now say what it costs.
* **[Campaign]** **A campaign could reach a state where passing the turn crashed, and stayed crashed.** The error was `IndexError: list index out of range` while the ambient supply convoys were being laid out, it repeated on every attempt, and the save could not be advanced again. The cause was a supply route whose two ends were the same base. The campaign loader matches a route's first and last waypoint to the nearest control point independently, so a one-waypoint route -- or a road drawn back onto its own field -- linked a base to itself, and a convoy was then ordered from that base to that base. Both halves are fixed: the loader now rejects a supply route or shipping lane whose two ends bind one base, naming it in a warning, and the convoy planners skip one that is already stored in a save. Four shipped campaigns carried one -- Operation Syrian Shield (Palmyra and Tiyas), Operation Allied Sword (FOB Samandag), and Scenic Route / Scenic Merge (Havadarya) -- all of them stray single-point markers, so no real road or sea lane was lost.
* **[Squadrons]** **Every F-14B(U) in a mission wore the same board number.** The Tomcat paints its modex into the livery texture -- no F-14 livery declares a number material, so DCS never draws the mission's board number on one -- and all five F-14B(U) squadron presets pinned a single livery, which put one number on the whole squadron. Each squadron now carries a livery set and the generator hands them out in order: the first jet of the mission wears the squadron's CAG bird (VF-103 AA100, VF-32 AC100), the rest are line jets. VF-101, VF-11 and VF-143 ship only two liveries in DCS, so those three alternate. The F-14B(U) was also missing from the modex list, so its board numbers were random where the F-14B's ran in sequence. Squadron liveries are stored in the save, so an existing campaign keeps its old livery -- NEW game required.
* **[Layouts]** Generic AAA sites can no longer be handed a radar the guns cannot use. The SON-9 "Fire Can" gun-laying radar is now its own `AAARadar` unit class, so a gun site's radar slot can never match a SAM search radar, and it only appears where a preset bundles it with its own guns. Adopted from upstream PR #902 (issue #901), extended to the Cold War Flak Site layout.
* **[Campaign]** **Tankers stop crossing the map to reach their own station.** The planner put one tanker station on the friendly base nearest the enemy and asked nothing about where tankers are based. On a Caucasus turn that stationed both on a sector HQ — the KC-135 **151 nautical miles** from it, and the carrier's A-6E **173 miles** from its own boat. Every carrier now gets its own tanker station and the land station goes to the most forward field that actually hosts a tanker, which is the arrangement the AWACS already used. On that save both transits drop to zero, and boom and probe receivers still each get a tanker that fits them. A wing with no carrier and one tanker base sees no change.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Aircraft carrying a long-range missile flew past their own launch range and died at the target.** A flight does not begin its attack until it reaches the package's ingress point, and that point was placed at a fixed distance from the target — 45 nautical miles on a modern campaign — whatever the aircraft was carrying. Fine for a bomb. For anything that shoots from further out (a Harpoon, a cruise missile on a strike, a Kh-22 that reaches 270 nm, a long-range anti-radiation missile on a SEAD run) the flight was dragged from a range where it could have fired, straight into the defences, and was shot down or turned back without ever launching. **A weapon can now declare its range**, and a package's run begins at the reach of its shortest-ranged shooter — one ingress serves the whole package, so it can only stand off as far as its weakest member, which is also why mixing a short-legged flight into a stand-off package is a real planning mistake. Escorts and anything else carrying no long-range weapon are ignored rather than counted as zero. The distance is capped at 60% of the leg from base to target so the run cannot begin behind the package's own join point. **This does not promise brochure range** — DCS releases at its own distance whatever the plan says; what it buys is that the flight is not already inside the defences when its attack begins. 25 weapons are given ranges to start with (Harpoon, SLAM-ER, HARM, Kh-22, Kh-35, Kh-59, JASSM-ER, LRASM, CALCM, Storm Shadow, Taurus and relatives); everything else is unchanged, including every weapon that already shoots from inside 45 nm. Applies to both sides. Diagnosis is juanjux's, from his fork. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[App]** **Retribution no longer freezes when DCS takes over the GPU.** Open Retribution, then launch DCS, and Retribution would hang — reliably, on at least one NVIDIA setup. Same root cause as the long-standing intermittent "Not Responding" when a dialog or panel is shown over the map. Qt 6.4 composites the embedded map through the **native desktop-OpenGL driver**, and that driver's context cleanup can deadlock while a fullscreen GPU application holds the card. Qt 6.8 composites the map through **Direct3D 11** instead, so the OpenGL context that deadlocked is never created — still hardware-accelerated, not the slow software path. PySide6 and Qt are upgraded 6.4.2 to 6.8.3 (with matching shiboken6); nothing else changes, and no application code needed altering — all 132 Qt calls the app makes resolve identically on both versions. **The deadlock is GPU- and driver-specific**, so it is worth a look on AMD and Intel hardware and on multi-monitor setups. Diagnosis and the in-game NVIDIA verification are juanjux's, from his fork of Retribution. Restart the app to pick it up.
* **[Campaign]** **Bombing a power station stopped mattering after one mission.** Killing an enemy comms mast or power station puts the air defences behind it out of action, and killing every command centre is supposed to leave the whole network fighting blind. That worked on the mission you flew right after the strike, and then quietly undid itself: the destroyed building was dropped from the network the next mission was built from, so the runtime had no dependency left to enforce and the SAMs came back fully operational. Losing every command centre was worse than useless — with nothing left to name, the network handed the enemy **perfect command back** instead of taking it away, while the campaign's own report still said their C2 was degraded. Destroyed command buildings now stay in the network as destroyed, so the suppression persists for as long as the rubble does, and the mission is told which ones died on earlier turns (it cannot work that out for itself — many of these are map scenery, not placed objects). Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Front-line ground units sat still and would not fight back.** Two separate faults, either of which was enough on its own. A group's initial hold was computed from a time difference that goes **negative** when a close air support package is due before the mission starts — and a negative difference was being read as **23 hours 59 minutes**, so the group was ordered to stand still for longer than any mission runs. Separately, defending groups were made to wait for the *enemy's* close air support to arrive before they could move or return fire, which is an attacker's concern, not a defender's; half an hour of standing there being shot at was an ordinary result. Both fixed: holds can no longer run past the mission, and only an attacking stance waits for air support. Worth knowing if you have tried to debug this in the Mission Editor — a hold is a running task, so putting the group on red alert or giving it a manual attack order does not shift it. Found in juanjux's fork of Retribution. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **A flight given an impossible time on target orbited the whole mission.** Flight plans are built backwards from the time on target, so a target time the flight cannot physically reach puts its push time *before* the mission starts. That negative time went into the mission as the hold's release condition, and DCS never fires a condition scheduled for a negative time — so the flight held at its orbit point until the mission ended and achieved nothing. The release is now clamped, and the flight goes and flies the mission. It will still be late; it just is not thrown away. Found in juanjux's fork of Retribution. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Campaign]** **The AWACS stops flying the map to reach its own orbit.** On a theater with no front line the planner put the AEW&C station at the friendly base nearest the enemy without checking whether any AWACS was based there. On a Syria turn that put the station at Ben Gurion while the wing's only E-3A sat on Cyprus, **182 nautical miles away**, and flew that each way — most of a sortie spent in transit. The station now prefers the most forward field that actually hosts an AWACS, which is the same rule already used on a theater with a front. On that save the transit drops to zero. Where no field hosts one — an all-carrier wing — nothing changes. One consequence worth knowing: the orbit sits where the aircraft can reach it from, so on a map where your AWACS is based well back, the station moves back with it.
* **[Mission Generation]** **How far a suppressed SAM drives is now a campaign setting.** When an anti-radiation missile is inbound, the IADS puts the site's alarm state to green and relocates it. That distance was fixed at 100–300 m inside the framework with no way to change it. **MANTIS IADS → SEAD evasion: how far a suppressed SAM relocates** takes 100–1000 m and defaults to 300, so nothing moves differently until you change it. Worth knowing before you raise it: the site goes weapons-free when the suppression window ends whether or not the drive has finished, and at the framework's 20 km/h relocation speed a 300 m move takes about 55 seconds against a window of roughly a minute and a half — so a large setting means the battery is still strung out on the road when it starts shooting again.
* **[Campaign]** **The mission summary's hit count is a hit count again.** The day's flying was reported as something like "106 shots for 381 hits" — more hits than shots, because a cluster weapon scores one impact per bomblet while counting as a single release. Hits are now matched back to the weapon that was actually fired, counted once each, so the figure reads as the hit rate it looks like. Gun hits are no longer included: the sim reports no shot for them, so there was nothing to rate them against.
* **[UI]** **Seven plugin options you could see but not change.** A plugin option whose value is text — the taxi card's ground frequency, the weapon-name lists that drive minefields, naval magazines and the Vietnam napalm and FAC options, and the red-scramble spawn mode — drew its label and then nothing at all, because the settings page only knew how to build a tick box or a number spinner. They now get a text field, and where the value is one of a fixed set, a dropdown: red scramble's spawn mode offers air, hot and runway, which is exactly what its script reads. A plugin shipping a default that is not one of its own listed choices is now caught when the plugin loads rather than when you first click the control.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Escorts let go of a package you are leading.** An escort or escort jammer stops escorting when the package's lead flight reaches its split point, and the mission signals that by having the lead run a script as it passes the waypoint. DCS does not run waypoint scripts for a flight a human is in, so whenever you led the package the signal never fired and your escorts stayed glued to you all the way home — landing at your field instead of their own. Measured on a Sinai SEAD mission: both EA-18Gs were fragged to recover on CVN-71 and instead followed the player's F-16 to Ramon Airbase. The signal is now also raised by the mission itself when your flight reaches the split point, which works whoever is in the cockpit, with a time backstop for a sortie that never flies through it. Escort jammers were additionally missing from the release entirely, even behind an AI lead. Knock-on effect worth knowing: an escort jammer that never releases keeps pulsing enemy SAMs into weapons-hold for as long as it trails you, so a SAM that felt strangely passive on the way out may simply have been held down by your own Growler. NEW mission required.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Takeoff and landing waypoints read the airfield's real elevation.** They were all written at zero — sea level, not ground level. That number is not cosmetic: it reaches the cockpit through the kneeboard card and the DTC steerpoint, so a field like Ramon Airbase at 2,031 ft read as being below the jet's own navigation solution. 105 of one flown mission's 192 waypoints sat at zero. Takeoff, landing and divert waypoints now carry the field's elevation above sea level, taken from the same elevation data the kneeboard already uses for QFE. Carrier and FARP recoveries stay at sea level, which is what they are. **Target waypoints still read zero on purpose** — that is what lets you slave a targeting pod to the mark. Campaigns already in progress pick this up on the next generated mission, not just new ones.
* **[Campaign]** **The mission report no longer counts anti-aircraft guns as flights.** The per-flight sortie record logged whatever DCS named as the shooter, so every AAA piece and Avenger that fired at a package turned up in the day's flying alongside the aircraft, along with one entry for cannon shells. Only aircraft are recorded now.
* **[Campaign]** **Support flights stop eating the escorts the strike packages needed.** Three taskings asked for an escort without marking it as one: front-line CAS asked for a SEAD Sweep, and the AWACS and tanker each asked for a fighter pair. An unmarked request is treated as part of the mission proper rather than as an escort, which means it is planned whether or not anything threatens the route, it can never be dropped when aircraft are short, and if it cannot be filled the whole package is cancelled — an AWACS with no spare fighter took the AWACS off the board entirely. On a Sinai turn-1 plan this put every one of the wing's twelve Growlers into escort slots, six of the sixteen escort fighters onto two AWACS orbits and a tanker, and left the one strike against an early-warning radar with no support at all. All three are now marked as escorts: planned when the route is threatened, dropped when it is not.
* **[Campaign]** **A package no longer takes three suppression flights while the package that needed them flies with none.** SEAD Escort, SEAD Sweep and a DEAD package's own SEAD flight all answer the same radar-SAM trigger, so one package could pull all three. The same Sinai plan put three Growler sections around two Harriers attacking a vehicle group. With **One SEAD flavour per package** on, a package takes the first suppression flight proposed and no more. Fighter escorts are unchanged — an anti-ship package still doubles them on purpose to saturate a ship's air defences. Off by default; part of the RetLab planner suite.
* **[Campaign]** **The AWACS orbits near the field it took off from.** The land AEW&C station was placed at whichever friendly base sat furthest from the threat, with no regard for where an AWACS actually was. On Sinai that base was 1.1 nm further back than the one the wing's only E-3 flew from, so the E-3 transited 245 nm to orbit beside a third field. The station now prefers an unthreatened base that has an AEW&C squadron, falling back to the old choice when none does. The same plan now flies 31 nm.
* **[Campaign]** **Carrier and LHA combat air patrols hand over instead of leaving a gap.** Land bases stagger each CAP wave to overlap the one before it. Ships queued theirs back to back on the previous wave's departure instead, so measured on Sinai a carrier's rounds sat 60 minutes apart against 45 for an airfield, leaving a hole every hour. Ships now use the same overlap. No change unless the overlap is set above zero.
* **[Campaign]** **Strategic bombers are no longer fragged onto a front line.** A B-52 or B-1 held a close air support priority just under the Harrier's, so the auto-planner sent one to bomb troops in contact. Heavy bombers already sit out armed reconnaissance for the same reason — they drop on called coordinates, not on targets they pick themselves — and they now sit out close air support too. Battlefield interdiction behind the lines is unchanged, as is the Arc Light carpet, which runs against a strike target.
* **[Mission Generation]** **The flight you are escorting no longer beats you to the target.** A flight sent to a tanker on the way in is given extra time in its schedule to sit on the boom, and it leaves its holding orbit that much earlier to pay for it — nine minutes for a two-ship, five for a single. That is right for a flight you are in, and wrong for every AI flight, because **AI never takes gas at a pre-vul tanker**: the refuel task ends as soon as each jet is at half fuel, which is already true when it arrives, and AI unlimited fuel (on by default until the join point) keeps the tanks full across that leg anyway. So the hold released the AI early and nothing used up the difference. Measured on one strike package: the AI strike reached the join **9 minutes early**, the AI recon Tomcat 5 minutes, and the one flight with no tanker stop exactly on time — so an escort that tanked as briefed arrived at the target after the bombs had already fallen. AI flights are no longer charged a stop they do not make, and now hold until the time their route actually needs. Player flights are unchanged, and the tanker still reserves the same on-station time. Takes effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Mission Generation]** **Civilian traffic no longer spawns below its stall speed, and now actually flies its flight level.** Two defects, both in the same layer. **The stall:** the civil layer plans cruise speeds in metres per second, but every pydcs speed argument is kilometres per hour, so a third of the intended figure reached the mission. Air-started transits — about 70% of the fixed-wing traffic — appeared at cruise altitude too slow to fly: An-26 at 65 kt at FL200, IL-76 at 108 kt at FL310, Yak-40 at 81 kt at FL260. Each dropped its nose and lost thousands of feet clawing back airspeed, and the slower ones did not recover. This is the same failure the QRA scramble hit when Moose air-spawned its interceptors at zero airspeed. The rotary layer's legs were commanded at 27 kt, and the ambient sampans and junks made way at 0.8 kt against a hull speed of 3. **The level:** rebuilding routes as single long transits removed the intermediate waypoints and nothing replaced them, so a civilian departing from a field had no waypoint at all between its takeoff and its landing — it flew a shallow climb straight into a descent and never reached the flight level its region assigns it, which is most of the point of assigning one. Transits now carry an explicit top of climb and top of descent. Both fixes take effect on the next generated mission.
* **[Campaign]** **Escort jammers now fly with the packages that need them.** The auto-planner had the distribution inverted: air assaults proposed an Escort Jammer while DEAD packages — the tasking that exists to penetrate a live radar-SAM ring — could never propose one at all. On a turn-1 Afghanistan ATO that meant both of blue's Growler sections escorted CH-47 assaults, launching from a base 89 nm away, joining 15 minutes behind the helicopters at 21,000 ft and turning for home on the second of the drop, while seven DEAD packages flew in unjammed. Air assault no longer asks for a jammer (its target area is already required to be clear of radar-SAM threat, so it never penetrates a ring), DEAD now does, and the escort-assignment rule that keeps fast jets off helicopter packages was extended to cover escort jamming — so no helicopter-led package, air assault or CSAR, pulls a Growler. Front-line CAS is unaffected.
* **[Campaign]** **A threatened package is escorted by one SEAD flavour instead of two.** SEAD Escort and SEAD Sweep were proposed on the same trigger, so any package on a radar-SAM-threatened route drew both — four jets against one threat on top of the A2A escort and the jammer, which put six escort aircraft around a two-ship helicopter insert. Packages now take the SEAD Escort, which rides with them; front-line CAS still gets a SEAD Sweep running ahead, where an independent path is the point. This generalises a trim DEAD packages already had.
* **[Campaign]** **An unavailable escort jammer no longer scrubs the whole package.** Under COIN and Vietnam doctrine, which are meant to fly unescorted rather than deadlock when fighters are scarce, the list of escorts a package may lose without being cancelled never included escort jamming. A strike whose Growler could not be filled was cancelled outright and a purchase order placed instead of the package simply flying without one.
* **[UI]** **The New Game wizard opens in the middle of the screen.** It had no placement of its own, so Windows parked it wherever it liked — usually off in a corner. It now centers on the monitor the app is already on, using the working area so a tall wizard clears the taskbar. Only on first open: a window you have dragged somewhere stays there.
* **[UI]** **The settings dialog no longer flashes a stack of empty windows as it opens.** Opening Settings threw up a run of bare little windows that appeared and vanished before the dialog showed. Each was a *section* of the settings page: the new filter pass decided which sections to show while they were still detached from their page, and Qt turns a visible detached widget into its own window. Sections now stay hidden until the page has adopted them.
* **[UI]** **Fixed "Save Settings" failing with "Circular reference detected".** Saving settings from any campaign started through the New Game wizard crashed with that error and wrote no file, because the record of which options your campaign pre-seeded couldn't be written to the settings file — and the error named nothing that would help you find it. Settings files now save (and load back) correctly; an unwritable value would now report its own type instead.
* **[Build]** **Fixed the release crashing on launch** with `mgrs.core.MGRSError: Unable to load libmgrs.cp311-win_amd64.pyd`. The recon-kneeboard map feature added the `mgrs` package as a dependency, and `mgrs` loads its compiled library via ctypes from *one level above* its own package folder — so PyInstaller's import analysis never saw the native `.pyd` and never bundled it, and the frozen app died on the first import at startup. The library is now bundled at the dist root, where both `mgrs`'s own lookup and the default DLL search next to the exe find it. This is the bug that made **v1.6.2-retlab crash immediately on a clean machine** (v1.6.1 predates the `mgrs` dependency, which is why it was unaffected); v1.6.3 supersedes it.
* **[Mission Generation]** Scenery objectives keep their kill-tracking trigger zones (and IADS command stand-ins) even when performance culling skips the rest of the objective. The map buildings backing a scenery objective exist whether or not the campaign spawns anything, so bombing one in a culled region used to visibly destroy a target whose death was never recorded at debrief.
* **[Mission Generation]** Cruise missile raid targets are no longer **performance-culled out of existence**. The auto raid usually strikes a rear-area objective no flight package is fragged against, so with performance culling on the target's buildings were never spawned into the mission — the missiles then visibly demolished the *map's* scenery at those coordinates while the campaign recorded no damage at all (flown and confirmed against a culled refinery: perfect impacts, zero effect). Planned raid targets and every launching ship group now get culling exclusion zones, so the campaign objects are really there when the salvo arrives. Marker call-for-fire into deep culled regions can still only hurt map scenery — aim marker strikes at campaign objects near the action, or widen the culling distance.
* **[Mission Generation]** Cruise missile strikes now see **carrier escorts**. The launching-ship scan only looked at standalone ship objects, but the vanilla Burke's usual home is a carrier task force — a different object category — so a CVBG's Tomahawk escorts got no magazine, no F10 "Cruise Missile Strike" menu, and no raids, silently (the feature looked enabled but nothing ever fired). Carrier and LHA task-force groups now count as launchers (the CVN itself carries no missiles — only its LACM escorts add to the group magazine), while enemy carrier groups remain un-raidable (moving naval targets stay the carrier-strike/ANTISHIP job).
* **[Mission Generation]** Fixed an unloadable-mission corner in the neutral-country pick: when every preferred neutral nation (UN Peacekeepers, Switzerland, USAF Aggressors) was already claimed by a belligerent — e.g. an Aggressors enemy faction against a coalition fielding UN and Swiss squadrons — the generator handed a claimed country to the neutral coalition anyway, putting one nation on two coalitions (DCS rejects the `.miz`). It now picks any genuinely unclaimed nation.
* **[Plugins]** Restored the **BigEye EWR** plugin to the active plugin list. It was the documented successor to the retired `ewrs` script, but had itself been silently dropped during the QRA-reserve integration — so the *BigEye EWR* option was missing from the Plugin Options page and players had no early-warning picture/threat-report calls despite the docs claiming the capability had moved to BigEye. (Off by default, like before.)
* **[Plugins]** Restored the **LotATC export** plugin to the active plugin list (it was silently dropped during the QRA-reserve integration, so the *LotATC Export* option had disappeared from the Plugin Options page even though its scripts still shipped). Also fixed a cross-wired option in its config: the "Export anti-air symbols" toggle was being read into the "Export BLUE anti-air" flag, so symbols couldn't be turned off and the blue-AA export was driven by the wrong checkbox. (Threat-circle export works on MANTIS; the optional NATO-name label on each ring relied on Skynet globals and stays blank now that Skynet is removed.)
* **[Air Defense]** Generic AAA sites are no longer auto-issued a search radar, so they generate as optically-guided guns instead of radar-directed flak. The shared `AAA Site` / `Cold War Flak Site` layouts kept a fill-by-default radar slot that pulled in *any* of the faction's search radars (sometimes even a SAM site's big search radar); the slot is now `fill: false`, so only groups that explicitly bring a radar (e.g. the KS-19's SON-9 Fire Can) are radar-directed.
* **[Air Defense]** Reworked the Cold War Flak Site, which previously fielded WWII German 8.8 cm Flak 18 guns for every faction that used it (US, Vietnam, Korea, Sweden, GDR, Israel, …). The hardcoded German gun preset is gone; the flak site is now a generic layout that each faction fills from its own era/nation-appropriate AAA pool.
* **[Air Defense]** In-progress campaigns self-heal on load: any stray search radar that an older build attached to an AAA site (e.g. a ZU-23 site wearing an SA-11 Buk search radar) is stripped, so the guns revert to optical and the site stops acting as a long-range radar/EWR node. The KS-19's SON-9 Fire Can is preserved.
* **[Mission]** Fixed a `woCharacterHuman` sim crash caused by orphaned civilian-helo spawns (civilian traffic is now airfields-only with deferred orphan despawn, and kept clear of the active battle).
* **[Debrief]** Player despawns are no longer counted as combat losses, and untracked ground-unit deaths are summarised in one log line.
* **[New Game]** Fixed a crash creating a new game from a malformed settings JSON member, and stopped seeded plugin-option defaults being dropped when merging campaign settings.
* **[Mission Generation]** Fixed crashes planning a strike against a fully-destroyed objective (divide-by-zero), the "Fix TOTs automatically" action, and player ground-start flights spawning in the air.
* **[Performance]** `is_on_land`/`is_in_sea` now test a prepared MultiPolygon, cutting ground generation from ~7 minutes to seconds.
* **[UI]** Player cold-start CAP is no longer flagged in the past-start-times warning.
* **[Server]** Bounded uvicorn's graceful shutdown so the app can no longer hang on exit.

# Retribution v1.6.0

## Features/Improvements
* **[RetLab]** Removed the Pretense campaign generator entirely (the "Generate a Pretense Campaign" menu action, the `game/pretense` generators, the `resources/plugins/pretense` Lua, the Pretense settings page, the `PRETENSE_CARGO` flight type, and the four `*_full.yaml` Pretense-tuned campaigns). RetLab fork no longer ships Pretense; old saves migrate cleanly (removed settings are dropped, any stray `Cargo Transport` flight type maps to `TRANSPORT`).
* **[Mission]** Add reactive GCI scramble support. RED untasked, uncontrolled, air-to-air-capable aircraft can sit cold on the ramp as dormant interceptors; when a Blue aircraft is detected by the RED radar network, `reactive_scramble.lua` wakes the nearest available group and tasks it to intercept.
* **[Mission]** Add JAMMING flight type for standoff electronic warfare aircraft (C-130J Compass Call). The aircraft holds an independent racetrack orbit at standoff range (same pattern as AEWC) rather than following a primary flight. Mixed packages pace their departure and TOT around the EW aircraft's slower transit. `c130j_mission_systems.lua` is automatically injected into any mission that includes a JAMMING flight.
* **[Kneeboard]** Use a light-grey daytime kneeboard background instead of near-white, to avoid glare under HDR / Auto-HDR while staying readable in daylight.
* **[UX]** Hovering a friendly flight's route line on the map highlights it in yellow, and clicking it selects that flight's package (and the flight) in the ATO sidebar.
* **[UX]** Press Delete with a package selected in the Packages list to cancel it, making it quick to clear several packages in a row.
* **[UX]** Avoid having escorts from wondering off too far while chasing a target.
* **[UX]** Improved fast-forward settings with the ability to skip combat.
* **[Data]** Add Refueling/Recovery tasks to A-6E Intruder mod
* **[Modding]** Add CurrentHill UK Assets Pack support (v1.1.2)
* **[Layouts]** Add signature to layouts' binary file for automatic reloading of updated layouts.
* **[Modding]** Add support for Su-35S mod (v2.0.27b)
* **[Plugins]** Update EW Script to version 2.1
* **[Options]** New option to spawn TACAN beacons at captured airfields
* **[UX]** Show an "End of Mission Detected, processing Mission Data" busy dialog while turn results are processed, so the wait is not mistaken for a missed detection
* **[Mission Generation]** DEAD and SEAD flights against a ground target now get one waypoint per individual target — the same targets (with coordinates) already listed on the SEAD/DEAD kneeboard page — so they can be designated quickly with TOO, just like Strike flights. The waypoints are player-only (AI tasking is unchanged), and targets the kneeboard does not list with coordinates (e.g. SEAD against a naval group) are unaffected. The SEAD/DEAD kneeboard target list also gains an "STPT" column showing each target's assigned waypoint number, matching the strike task page.
* **[Mission Generation]** Reworked AI plain-SEAD behaviour: instead of firing a scripted point-in-time attack at ingress, SEAD flights now loiter at a standoff orbit (a new SEAD_LOITER anchor held at a configurable multiple of the strongest threat range) and engage radars reactively as they come up, with a computed break-off window. New doctrine settings: standoff factor and maximum loiter window.
* **[Map]** Hovering a SAM threat or detection ring highlights its emitter — and hovering an emitter highlights its ring — making it easy to tell which site a ring belongs to. Can be disabled from the map's layer control.
* **[Mission Generation]** AI DEAD flights now receive the best available standoff/PGM loadout for their airframe instead of a generic anti-radiation fit.
* **[AirWing]** Squadron names in the Air Wing dialog are clickable and the list shows idle-aircraft counts.
* **[UX]** Auto-assigned TACAN codes are surfaced more clearly in control-point tooltips and the briefing.
* **[Cheats]** Give or take money to/from both OWNFOR and OPFOR.
* **[Map]** Blue non-carrier ships are movable on the campaign map — drag one to queue a destination; red ships and their queued moves stay hidden.
* **[Finances]** The Finances dialog shows income, automated HQ spending per category, and the net change per turn.
* **[Mission]** New "Player at IP" fast-forward stop condition, plus more robust fast-forward halting and combat-skip handling.
* **[UI]** The base menu intel summary is regrouped into Air / Ground / Status sections with a parking-slot breakdown; QRA-alert count and recon-fogged ammo/factory state are preserved.
* **[Map]** Carrier/LHA ship groups now appear on the map like other naval groups, including their air-defense rings; control-point tooltips list the surviving escort units.
* **[Mission Generation]** Non-DEAD-role aircraft can be hand-assigned DEAD as a secondary task (19 airframes gain a DEAD secondary task; auto-planner priorities unchanged).
* **[Map]** Selecting a flight draws a tactical overlay reflecting the AI's planned actions — strike attack geometry and the SEAD loiter/HARM-reach bubble (the latter keeps the fork's fixed-range bubble).
* **[UI]** Waypoint editing: reorder waypoints, edit ToTs and on-station timing, with a warning when manual timing may drift from the package's escorts.
* **[Mission Generation]** Player waypoint renames propagate to the aircraft CDU/HUD; the Strike Task page reflects renames without leaking the F-15E DTC slot tag into other pages.
* **[Plugins]** ATIS for player flights via a MOOSE voice-ATIS plugin (per-airfield ATIS frequencies and spoken reports).
* **[Kneeboard]** New recon kneeboard pages — target reconnaissance (aimpoints, threat rings, area context), a friendly-packages coordination list, and a package-targets theater map. Basemap tiles are fetched and cached at mission generation (offline coastline fallback); adds the `mgrs` dependency and new Kneeboard settings.
* **[Mission Generator]** New campaign setting "Default laser code for Player flights" controls whether newly-created player flights are assigned a unique allocated TGP/weapon laser code (the new default, matching existing behavior) or stay on 1688. When a code is allocated it is applied to both the TGP/kneeboard code and the weapon code by default, so LGBs home on the player's own code without extra clicks; both remain independently overridable in the payload tab.
* **[Engine]** Support for DCS 2.9.28.26283 including F-100D, F-14A (Export), and F-14BU.
* **[Options]** Add new option to fast forward until player is at the IP.
* **[Modding]** Update to CJS Super Hornet Mod to v2.4.5.260501.RC1
* **[Modding]** Update Community A4EC Mod to 2.3.0 (May 2025)
* **[Mission Generator]** Squadrons now spawn using the proper country instead of CTJF, enabling various DCS AI voiceovers
* **[Campaigns]** Ability to define motor pool objects which spawn reserve armor
* **[Campaigns]** Motorpool placement is Garage_A-anchored and empty reserve pools are excluded from attack planning; updated placement measurements are documented.
* **[UX]** Add the ability to filter campaigns by version, map, and performance — and, in Vietnam mode, by era.
* **[Engine]** Bump campaign version to 10.9 for motorpool support
* **[Modding]** Update UH-60L mod to v2.1.5 including MH-60L DAP

## Fixes
* **[Mission Generator]** Dynamically allocated TACAN channels no longer collide with map beacons: DME/VOR-DME beacons (which share TACAN's channelization) are now blacklisted alongside TACAN/VORTAC, and beacons whose DCS data omits a channel (e.g. Syria's KALDE "KAD" VOR-DME) have their channel/band derived from the beacon's VHF frequency per the ICAO VOR/TACAN channelling plan instead of being silently skipped. The "Assign TACAN" dialog now warns in real time when the selected channel/band is already in use by a map beacon or another carrier/airfield/flight. (#36)
* **[Map]** Right-clicking a front line under a blue flight-plan route now opens the new-package dialog instead of the browser context menu (the route's invisible hover overlay swallowed the click).
* **[Data]** The F-14A-135-GR Early's payload file declared the wrong unitType, so the Early Tomcat flew every tasking unarmed; its loadouts now resolve (with a guard test pinning the payload to the airframe). (#889)
* **[Mission Generator]** EWR sites now get the DCS "EWR" enroute task and come up on RED alarm, so their radars actually scan and report contacts (previously they could sit inert, especially with the "red alert state" performance option off). Complements the MANTIS IADS engine, which reads EWR detections but never managed the task list.
* **[Naval]** Fleets actively defend: warship groups spawn on RED alarm with weapons-free ROE instead of sitting passive (upstream #868).
* **[Plugins]** CTLD now treats a landed helicopter as on-ground using terrain AGL, so unload/extract works on sloped terrain.
* **[Plugins]** Fix the escort leash never running (DCS has no `Group.getByID`; look the group up by name via mist), so escorts are actually held to their engagement range.
* **[Kneeboard]** Fixed waypoint numbering for in-air-start flights.
* **[Mission]** Fixed DCS rejecting missions that had a locked-speed waypoint between two TOT-locked waypoints.
* **[Settings]** Legacy pre-#684 fast-forward settings are migrated on load instead of crashing; a stale or garbled enum setting now falls back to its default rather than failing the load.
* **[Flight Plans]** Fixed IndexError crash when a flight exits combat at its last waypoint
* **[AI]** Fixed enemy AWACS orbit placement — AI AWACS (A-50, etc.) was orbiting toward the threat boundary and loitering near the front line. It now orbits in the opposite direction, deep inside friendly airspace. Player-coalition AWACS keeps the existing forward-leaning behavior.
* **[App]** Retribution no longer stays alive in the background after its window is closed: the API server's graceful shutdown is now bounded (uvicorn otherwise waited forever on the long-lived event-stream websocket and the join hung).
* **[App]** Relaunching the executable while it is already running no longer spawns orphaned, windowless duplicate processes; a second instance detects the first via an OS file lock and exits immediately.
* **[Mission]** Reliably auto-detect end of mission, even when DCS wrote the final state.json before the wait dialog started watching
* **[Performance]** Faster post-mission turn processing
* **[AirWing]** Track per-squadron campaign aircraft stats (initial/destroyed/purchased, save-compatible) and expose pilot experience level and living/dead pilot views for the UI
* **[AirWing]** Squadron list shows living-pilot, aircraft and unassigned counts; squadron dialog shows each pilot's experience level, lists killed-in-action pilots separately and hides the redundant "Active" status
* **[AirWing]** Squadron dialog shows the aircraft type, an aircraft inventory (initial/current/destroyed/purchased), and buy/sell aircraft controls with price, on-order count and available parking slots
* **[AirWing]** Air Wing list shows a "transfer ordered to X" indicator, and Airfield Command lists the units transferring into the base next turn
* **[AirWing]** Squadron transfer-destination parking now accounts for already-ordered incoming transfers, matching the Airfield Command hangar count

## Fixes
* **[UI]** Avoid a crash dialog ("'QWidgetItem' object has no attribute 'width'") when a list using the two-column row delegate relayouts with a malformed style option under PySide6 6.4.x.
* **[App]** Fix Retribution sometimes staying alive in the background after the window is closed.
* **[Mission Generation]** Anti-Ship flights now attack the carrier group the flight plan routes to instead of the control point's first ground object, so strikes against carrier groups no longer leave the AI without a target (it would fly to the ingress point and turn back without engaging).
* **[Flight Plans]** Player flights with a ground start (Cold/Warm/Runway) no longer spawn in the air when their computed startup time falls before mission start (e.g. due to a long player startup estimate); they now wait and start on the ground at mission start.
* **[Mission]** Fix a crash when choosing "Fix TOTs automatically" in the past-start-times dialog at Take Off: the automatic fix called `TotEstimator.earliest_tot()` without the required current-time argument and raised a `TypeError`.
* **[Mission Planning]** Carrier/LHA targets now offer SEAD in the flight-task list and no longer list SEAD Escort twice (their escorts are SAM platforms, so they can be suppressed directly like any other naval group).
* **[Performance]** Improved robustness w.r.t. state.json handling to avoid corruption and thus save loss.
* **[Flight Plans]** Stabilized waypoint solver debug GeoJSON coordinate precision to avoid platform-specific floating point drift in debug output.
* **[Mission Generation]** Assign plane-specific laser codes to LGB weapons when building the mission
* **[Engine]** Fixed a bug where squadrons could transfer to enemy owned control points
* **[Mission Generation]** Air assault drop-off zones are kept on land, so coastal objectives no longer drop the troops into the sea.
* **[Mission Generation]** Relocate ground units that spawn on inland water (ponds, rivers, lakes) to the nearest land at mission start, fixing armor and SAM sites spawning underwater (#59).
* **[Mission Generation]** Relocate ships that spawn on land (e.g. carrier escorts when the carrier hugs the shore) to the nearest deep water at mission start (#59).

* **[Mission Generation]** Fixed mission scripting error caused by control points with apostrophes in their names, such as Tha'lah.
* **[Modding]** Campaigns that used quad zones for scenery targets will no longer load. Only circular zones were ever supported, but an implementation quirk allowed them to load in a way that would misbehave. A "No white triggerzones found" message during campaign generation is the sign of a broken campaign.
* **[Modding]** Loadouts with invalid weapons (typically new DCS weapons not yet available in Liberation) will be ignored rather than causing an error.
* **[Squadrons]** Fixed issue in air wing configuration that would allow squadrons to be created with no home base if no base was available.
