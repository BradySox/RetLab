/**
 * Shared semantic colours for the campaign map.
 *
 * The map overlays had each hardcoded their own red / amber / green, so "red"
 * meant six different things across components and two dashed-red circles read as
 * the same thing while meaning opposites. This is the single source of truth: a
 * component (and the on-map legend) decodes a colour by its *meaning*, not its hex.
 *
 * Values match the pre-existing de-facto colours, with these deliberate calls:
 *   - SUSPECTED (a concealed, un-reconned enemy) is an amber dash — "unknown,
 *     investigate" — over a dark-red casing (enemy allegiance), now that dashed
 *     red is no longer reserved for the removed ROE off-limits zones; a centred
 *     "?" glyph marks it as a go-look contact. The two channels carry two facts:
 *     the red halo says "enemy", the amber dash says "we don't know where yet".
 *   - ROUTE_FRIENDLY is lifted off the near-black navy that vanished on satellite
 *     imagery to a legible blue.
