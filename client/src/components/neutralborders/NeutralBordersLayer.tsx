// §96: every country on the map, and what its airspace does to you.
//
// Two channels, and they answer different questions.
//
//   HUE  - whose airspace: red enemy-held, blue friendly, grey fought over by
//          both, mint uninvolved.
//   SHADE- will it intercept you. Only ONE state does: a country not in the
//          war that refuses you transit. That state alone gets a real fill.
//
// A country in the war is drawn as a solid outline over a faint wash. Its sky
// is governed by its own side's QRA, not by this feature, and its allegiance is
// already carried by the unit icons, the threat rings and the front line --
// filling it as heavily as a hostile neutral washed half the Syria map pink.
// Dashes are reserved for a boundary you have to make a decision about.
//
// Every stroke is CASED (the dark halo the rest of the overlay family uses).
// Without it a friendly country's blue line was lost among the blue flight
// paths and read as its enforcing neighbour's crimson -- a faint line is not a
// quiet line, it is an absent one.
//
// The DCS F10 map draws the same states, but by then the route is flown. The
// decision the feature asks for -- go around, or go through -- is made in the
// planner, so the lines have to be visible here too.
//
// Renders nothing unless neutral_border_defense is on (the list is empty),
// matching the minefields / culling-zone layers.
