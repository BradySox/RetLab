# Skynet is the IADS engine again — the MANTIS detour, closed

**Date:** 2026-09-12 (DM call)
**Replaces:** `414th-mantis-iads-HANDOFF.md`, `414th-mantis-migration-notes.md`,
`414th-mantis-vs-skynet-iads-parity.md`, `414th-mist-moose-shim-notes.md` — all four deleted
in the same change. `git show <this commit>^:docs/dev/design/<name>` recovers them.
**In-game pass:** checklist row G42.

## 1. The decision

The fork runs upstream's Skynet-IADS again, on upstream's MIST. The MOOSE MANTIS bridge
(`mantisiads`, 2026-06-24 to 2026-09-12) and the MIST-to-MOOSE shim (`mist_moose_shim.lua`,
2026-07-10 to 2026-09-12) are removed. Every other MOOSE plugin stays: upstream bundles
`Moose.lua` itself, and QRA, TIC, CSAR, Vietnam Ops, cruise missiles, ATIS and BigEye run on it.

Scope was put to the DM as a choice and the answer was "Skynet + MIST only".

## 2. Why — the evidence

- **Skynet was never shown broken.** The parity note that made the 2026-06 decision recorded
  zero Skynet defects. Its reasons were a squadron member's opinion, "dormant" maintenance
  (last release 2023-12-29) and the MIST retirement. Its own verdict said "Skynet is actively
  broken right now is NOT established."
- **Every IADS bug since June was MANTIS or our bridge.** The prefix bug that left MANTIS
  controlling 0 SAMs for weeks (06-26); the SA-10 typed as a 6 km POINT site (06-27); the
  ground-start AWACS dropped from the net (06-27); the blind-network problem; the C2 layer dying
  after one mission (08-19, Python-side, found by juanjux #97 against Skynet).
- **The EWR corrections were forced by MANTIS's model, not by Skynet.** A Skynet SAM with no
  EWR coverage defaults to autonomous DCS AI and still fights (`AUTONOMOUS_STATE_DCS_AI` is the
  SAM-site default). A MANTIS SAM never self-detects, so the same laydown produced a blind net.
  Every EWR fix (the blind-network warning 06-27, the P-14/1L13 sites 07-04, the
  `fallback_classes` restore 07-27, the backstop removal 08-06) landed after the switch.
- **The diff-from-upstream argument was measured.** Against upstream's tip the fork's diff is
  334k lines. Skynet, MIST, the shim and the MANTIS bridge together are 16k of it (5 %).
  Restoring them is real and cheap; the fork's diff is the planner, the features, the tests and
  the campaigns.
- **HDSUC ships no Skynet profiles.** The installed mod folder has none. The S-400 / S-300V4 /
  SAMP/T / Pantsir-SM profiles are ours, from #851, carried in juanjux's open upstream #956.

## 3. What was restored, and from where

| File | Source | Delta from upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `resources/plugins/base/mist_4_5_126.lua` | upstream `dev` | byte-identical (same blob as the copy deleted 2026-07-10) |
| `resources/plugins/base/plugin.json` | upstream `dev` | plus the fork's `sortie_recorder.lua` work order |
| `resources/plugins/skynetiads/plugin.json`, `LICENSE.md` | upstream `dev` | byte-identical |
| `resources/plugins/skynetiads/skynet-iads-compiled.lua` | upstream #956 head (`juanjux/hds_2_1_0_and_ultimate`) | see §4 |
| `resources/plugins/skynetiads/skynetiads-config.lua` | upstream `dev` | see §5 |

Upstream's compiled Skynet has not changed since our removal (last real edit 2025-01, #443).

## 4. The compiled build — three layers

1. **Upstream's vendored Skynet** (baron-branch, build 2023-05-16), with Retribution's own
   hand-added units (P-37 in the S-200 profile, the HDS SA-10B block). Adding `samTypesDB`
   entries here is the accepted pattern.
2. **The HDSUC profiles from #956**: S-400, S-300V4, SAMP/T, Pantsir-SM, and the renamed
   SA-10B radars. This is our #851 work as upstream will ship it, so the fork converges on
   upstream's file when #956 merges. **Drift-watch #956.**
3. **CurrentHill SAM profiles from `HFXLegion/Skynet-IADS`** (Apache-2.0, the same licence
   as Skynet): the Russia, US, UK, Germany and China packs — Buk-M3, S-350, Pantsir-S1/S2,
   Tor-M2, Patriot (CH), NASAMS 3, THAAD, HQ-22, Sky Sabre and the rest. That fork is walder's
   Skynet plus these data files and nothing else (2 commits ahead, 0 behind, 2025-07). Its
   `sampack_s300` file is **not** taken: it overlaps the #956 profiles and would override the
   SA-10 block. 14 of its 64 unit ids name units no fork faction fields (the Germany pack and
   newer US-pack Patriots); an unmatched profile is inert.

Plus one fork line: `P14_SR` in the S-200 search-radar block, because the two SA-5 Legacy
Site layouts pair the S-200 with a Tall King. Coverage audit 2026-09-12: of the 151 unit ids
the anti-air layouts and preset groups field, every radar id is in the database.

## 5. The config bridge — upstream's plus two additions

Upstream's `skynetiads-config.lua` is kept whole. Two blocks are added, both harness-tested
in `tests/lua/test_skynet_bridge.py`:

- **DeadC2.** The campaign emits, per coalition, the C2 nodes it already knows are destroyed
  (`IadsNetwork.dead_c2_names`, kept from the 08-19 fix). Skynet reads a SAM with no comms or
  power object as fully connected (`genericCheckOneObjectIsAlive` returns true on an empty
  list), and a node killed on an earlier turn may have no DCS object left (destructible scenery
  never has one). The bridge registers each named node as a stand-in that answers
  `isExist() == false`; a command centre stand-in also answers its coalition and type. Skynet
  asks nothing else of a node object. Without this, the SAMs behind a bombed power station come
  back fully operational on the next turn, and losing every command centre hands the coalition
  perfect command (`isCommandCenterUsable` is true on an empty list).
- **AWACS fold.** A ground-starting AWACS is not a spawned group when the bridge runs, and
  upstream's bridge skips it for the whole mission. Ours keeps looking every 60 s for 90 min,
  reading the coalition from the campaign's `AWACs` entry (emitted by `luagenerator`), and
  adds the aircraft once it exists. Skynet accepts a new EWR after activation.

## 6. Constraints carried over from the MANTIS period

These cost missions to learn and still hold, or hold in a changed form:

- **`enableEmission` is what Skynet uses to go live and dark** (three calls in the compiled
  file). The hard constraint that `enableEmission(false)` crashed DCS came from the C-130 line,
  where the script toggled it on player-driven events; upstream has flown Skynet on it for years
  and this fork did until June without a recorded crash. Row G42 watches for it. The C-130,
  growler and cruise-missile plugins still never touch emissions; they hold sites with ROE
  `WEAPON_HOLD`, and Skynet re-asserts ROE itself, so those writes are self-healing under it.
- **A campaign still needs early warning.** Under Skynet an uncovered SAM fights autonomously
  rather than staying blind, so the failure is softer, but a network with no EWR and no AWACS is
  a set of isolated sites, not an IADS. The `fallback_classes` on the EWR layout stays
  load-bearing.
- **The dead-C2 graph fix is Python-side and stays.** `iads_nodes` keeps dead C2 nodes and
  edges; `DeadC2` names them. This is the juanjux #97 hole, which was live against Skynet too.
- **Skynet has no name-prefix matching**, so the `escape_prefix` lesson does not apply to it.
  It still applies to every MOOSE `SET_*` filter the fork uses (intercept, cruise missiles).
- **Never spawn a backstop EWR** (§1) and **never double-count radars** (§60 vs regiments)
  are engine-independent and unchanged.
- **Point defence** is explicit under Skynet (`addPointDefence`, from the emitted `PD`
  arrays), so the SEAD-triggered SHORAD link that the MANTIS bridge built has a native
  equivalent. Row G30 is re-pointed at it.

## 7. What was removed with the bridge

- The MANTIS plugin options: emissions control, the SEAD scoot radius (B81), the MEZ band
  override, the per-band active-SAM caps, the SHORAD link timings, the C2 poll. Skynet's own
  options (`actMobile*`, `adjustGoLiveRange*`, the radio menu) are back in their place.
- The generation-time blind-network warning in `luagenerator`. Under Skynet an uncovered site
  goes autonomous, so the warning's premise ("its SAMs will never engage") is false.
- `MANTIS_MANAGED_ROLES` in the AI-sleep emitter is `IADS_MANAGED_ROLES`: the same three roles,
  because Skynet drives the same groups.
- The `engine` marker in the emitted IADS table. Nothing reads it.
- The Lua harness tests for the bridge and the shim.

## 8. Not done, and why

- **No engine selector.** Upstream has none; the `IadsEngine` enum stub stays only so
  2026-06 to 2026-09 saves unpickle, and `_migrate_legacy_settings` drops the value.
- **The HDS fallback_classes / faction EWR content** is untouched. It was right for MANTIS and
  is still right.
- **The MOOSE plugins are untouched.** Rolling back MOOSE was put to the DM and declined; it is
  not a diff reducer.

## Flown 2026-09-15 (test 32) — AI DEAD against a netted site

Two identical DEAD four-ships met two SA-11 sites on one AI-only Persian Gulf turn.

- WEKA's target had already lit up on the SEAD escort Hornets ahead of it. The Vipers fired
  eight HARMs, killed two launchers, and came home. The two Hornets died lighting it.
- KIWI's target stayed dark until the Vipers were inside 30 km, then fired ten. All four
  Vipers and the Mirage escort died. Not one shot was fired back.

The mechanism, read from the compiled Skynet: a netted site's default is
`GO_LIVE_WHEN_IN_KILL_ZONE` (line 3040), and DCS AI fires a HARM only at an emitter. A site is
live from T0 only when it is autonomous (`setToCorrectAutonomousState`): no covering EWR or
SAM-as-EWR in detection range with power and comms, no usable command centre, or no active
connection node. The sites-dark half of G42 works exactly as designed and it costs every AI
DEAD flight its shot.

The planner-side answer is recorded as row 8 of
[retlab-planner-doctrine-mining-notes.md](retlab-planner-doctrine-mining-notes.md): AI DEAD in
net order. The DM took the minimal shape the same day: `DegradeIads` offers detectors before
opportunistic SAMs, the reactive tier is unchanged, and the full coverage-query rule stays
recorded and unbuilt. Do not tune `adjustGoLiveRange` for this without a fresh call, and do
not plan the escort as bait. In-game row: B126.

Checked on the CSAR save the same evening: inert there. Every blue DEAD comes from the reactive
tier, and each red site has 2–6 covering EWRs at 162–216 nm plus 1–4 SAM-as-EWR parents, so no
EWR-first ordering cuts the net. What does cut it is the command-centre pair: with both dead
`isCommandCenterUsable` is false and every site goes autonomous, which for vanilla units means
live from T0. That is the lever a future rule would use, and it is not built.

Also seen: `0002 | OKAPI (SAM)`, an SA-11 site regenerated as four launchers after losing its
search radar and command post on turn 1, is rejected by `setupElements` (no search radar) and
fights as plain DCS AI, radiating from T0. Its eight launches killed three BARCAP Tomcats. Any
radar SAM that loses its search radar comes back this way; it is outside the net and HARM-able.

## The flag defaults from the miz (2026-09-21)

`advanced_iads` only chooses the network mode. What range mode consumes is the command
centre, comms tower and power station statics the author placed, and with none of them
the flag changes nothing: every site is a node with no connections, which is basic mode
by another name. Measured across the 54 campaigns without the flag (50 omit it, 4 write
`false`): 51 place no buildings at all, and 3 placed them without the flag — Desert Sabre
(12 comms towers, 12 power stations, and `advanced_iads: false` written over them), Allied
Sword (a command centre, 2 power stations), Retake the Falklands (2 command centres, a
comms tower). Their SAMs were never wired to the buildings standing beside them.

- `Campaign.from_file` now sets the flag whenever the miz places any of the three statics
  (`miz_carries_iads_infrastructure`, a text scan of the zip's mission entry, under a
  second for the whole catalogue). An explicit `false` does not override the buildings —
  Desert Sabre is the case that decided it — and the wizard's Advanced IADS box, which is
  enabled for any campaign the flag is on for, is the per-game opt-out.
- **Nothing is placed** (DM call 2026-09-21). A campaign with no buildings stays basic.
  Synthesising infrastructure for the 51 was proposed and declined.
- `tests/retlab/test_iads_promotion.py`. The in-game half is row B133's pass on one of
  the three: a Desert Sabre SAM goes down with the power station beside it.
