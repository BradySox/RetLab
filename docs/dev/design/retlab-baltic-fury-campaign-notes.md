## Concept

Modern day (2027). A Russian offensive overran Schleswig-Holstein, seized the Baltic coast,
forced the Danish straits and took **Copenhagen** — then culminated. NATO answers **from the
sea**: a US carrier strike group (CVN-75 Truman) in the German Bight + RetLab's USAF F-22 +
F-15E wing at Nordholz. Break the coastal anti-ship / SAM belt, win the air battle over the
Baltic approaches, roll the enemy up the coast (Lübeck → Rostock → Peenemünde), force the
straits, and **liberate Copenhagen**.

The maritime northern flank Red Tide never fights: Red Tide is the Fulda Gap (S→N); this is the
sea, **west→northeast**. Same *Red Storm Rising* DNA, opposite axis.

- **Map:** GermanyCW · **Date:** 2027-07-17 · **Posture:** blue counter-offensive (enemy
  culminated; NATO out-produces — money 800/400, income ×1.3/×0.7).
- **Blue faction:** `NATO Baltic 2027` (`resources/factions/nato_baltic_2027.json`) — the
  purpose-built coalition, added 2026-08-02. `USA 2020`'s wing and OOB (carrier Rhinos +
  USAF F-22/F-15E; CH USA pack) **plus the two allies the Baltic actually belongs to**:
  - **Sweden** — a NATO member since March 2024, fighting in its home water, and the
    richest CH pack after USA/Russia (42 units). It closes gaps blue genuinely had:
    the **LvS-103** battery (`LvS-103 Rb103A/B` ± Mobile) gives blue its own long-range
    area SAM, and **RBS-15** gives blue a *coastal anti-ship* battery — the mirror of
    red's Bastion/Bal wall, which turns the campaign's signature fight into a
    coastal-vs-coastal duel rather than a one-sided belt-breaking problem. Plus
    RBS-70/90/98 SHORAD, the UndE 23 search radar, **Visby corvettes + CB90 (Strb 90)**
    for archipelago littoral, and Strv 122/123 / Strf 9040 / Archer ashore.
  - **United Kingdom** — the Joint Expeditionary Force, the Northern-Europe framework.
    **Type 45** (area air defence) and **Type 26** (ASW) for the CSG screen, **Sky Sabre**
    (C2 + Giraffe + iLauncher) and Stormer HVM over recaptured fields, Challenger 3 /
    Warrior / Ajax / AS-90 ashore.

  Country is `Combined Joint Task Forces Blue`, and `locales` carries `en_US` + `sv_SE` +
  `en_GB` so §23 gives Swedish and British squadrons their own comms identity and
  nation-appropriate pilot names instead of one shared US voice.

  **The Gripen is the one allied *airframe*** (the rest of the allied contribution is
  ground/naval/AD). `[CH] JAS 39C Gripen` ships **inside the CurrentHill Sweden pack** and is
  gated by `swedishmilitaryassetspack` — **not** by the separate `jas39_gripen` ModSetting,
  which gates the community mod's unrelated `JAS39Gripen` airframe. Preseeding the wrong one
  strips the squadron silently, so the pairing is pinned in the tests.

  **The Finnish Hornet detachment (2026-08-02).** Finland joined NATO in **April 2023** —
  before Sweden — and its F/A-18Cs were bought as interceptors, so BARCAP is the
  historically honest role. **HävLLv 31** (Fighter Squadron 31, Karjalan Lennosto at
  Rissala — the Russia-facing Finnish fighter squadron) sits at **Hamburg**, `primary:
  BARCAP`, `country: Finland`, 8 airframes. Two reasons for that placement:
  - **It closes a real hole.** Blue flew **zero** BARCAP squadrons against red's **six** —
    nothing stood a barrier patrol over blue's own fields. (Anti-ship looked like the other
    candidate gap, but the fork rates the F/A-18C **`Anti-ship: 150`**, so the Harpoon idea
    is not supported by the unit data; its strengths are OCA/Aircraft 730 and BARCAP 555.)
  - **Hamburg is blue's most exposed base** — ~53 km from the nearest red field, vs 137 km
    (Nordholz), 152 km (Bremen), 289 km (the carrier) — and it had **no fast air at all**,
    only A-10s, Apaches and lift.

  Unlike the CH Gripen (an AI-only mod airframe), the **F/A-18C is a full-fidelity module**,
  so this is a *flyable* seat — the reason it went to Finland rather than onto the boat: the
  USN retired legacy Hornets from carrier decks in 2019, so a CVN Hornet squadron in 2027
  would be an anachronism the Finnish one avoids.

  The Gripen is authored as a squadron too, not just a faction entry: **F 17 Blekinge Wing** (the real
  Baltic-facing Gripen wing, Ronneby/Kallinge) forward-deployed to **Nordholz**, `primary:
  DEAD`, `country: Sweden`, 8 airframes. That is a capability fix as much as flavour — blue's
  only other dedicated SEAD/DEAD unit is the carrier's Growler squadron, which is thin against
  an 11-site S-400/S-300 belt, and the CH Gripen's unit yaml carries **`DEAD: 790`**, the
  highest task priority in its own file. Its **RBS-15 Mk4** (160 NM) also gives blue a second
  anti-ship shooter against the Baltic Fleet SAG, and **Taurus KEPD-350** (270 NM) reaches the
  coastal belt from standoff.

  **Mod-gated:** the campaign preseeds `swedishmilitaryassetspack` + `ukmilitaryassetspack`
  alongside the USA pack. A missing pack **strips** those units from the faction (it does
  not fail), so the preseeds are load-bearing — pinned in
  `tests/retlab/test_baltic_fury.py`, along with a silent-drop guard that asserts every
  authored unit string resolves (the CH 1.5.0 rename wave is exactly how a contingent would
  quietly empty) and a mods-off guard that the faction degrades to its vanilla core rather
  than crashing.

- **Enemy faction:** `Redfor (Russia) 2020` — unchanged except for one addition. A full
  pack audit on 2026-08-02 (resolving preset-group members and aircraft, not just loose
  unit strings) found it fields **37 of the CH Russia pack's 55** units. The 18 it does not:
  - **13 legacy Soviet armour/artillery** (T-54, T-62M, T-72A/B, BMP-1/1P, BMD-2, BTR-50PK,
    MT-LB, PT-76B, ASU-85, 2S1, 2S3, ZSU-23-4, 9K35) — correctly era-excluded from a *2020*
    faction. Worth revisiting **for this campaign only**: Baltic Fury's premise is that the
    Russian offensive **culminated**, and an army feeding reserve stocks into the line is
    that story told in units. It would need a Baltic-specific red faction — `Redfor (Russia)
    2020` is shared by 4 campaigns (Baltic Fury, Slava Ukraini, Clash of the Titans,
    Graveyard of Empires). **Deliberately not done**; recorded here as the open option.
  - **`[CH] Iskander-K GLCM`** — a genuine gap, now **closed**: red fielded the ballistic
    Iskander-**M** but not the **cruise** variant. Added to the shared faction's `missiles`
    (purely additive, all 4 campaigns headless-verified to still load).
  - 2 non-combat objects (`BMD4_cargo`, `TM62_AT_Mine`) — no unit data, skipped.

  ⚠️ **Counting gotcha for future audits:** `[CH] Iskander-M SRBM` and `SRBM 9K720 Iskander
  HE [CH]` are two display names for the **same** unit (`CHAP_9K720_HE`, from the CH →
  ED-integrated CHAP wave), and faction collections dedupe by unit type — so the missiles
  list reads "4 authored, 3 resolved" and that is correct, not a silent drop. Any
  drop-detector needs `>=` against *distinct units*, not authored-string count.

  On the blue side the equivalent audit found **59 of 60** CH USA units fielded; the sole
  gap is `CH_B-21`, which has no unit yaml and is already tracked as an open faction call
  in the CH-wave adoption backlog. Left open deliberately.
- **Enemy faction:** `Redfor (Russia) 2020` — maritime Russia: coastal anti-ship + Baltic Fleet
  + S-400/BUK-M3; CH Russia pack.
- **Sweden:** neutral (southern Swedish fields left out).

### Verified geography
- Carrier box **`[127353, -868754]`** = 55.0N 6.8E (nearest land field Nordholz @ 100 nm).
- Carrier→Copenhagen 205 nm · carrier→Nordholz 100 nm.
- The only blue↔red supply route is **Hamburg (17) → Lübeck (81)**, so the turn-1 front sits at
  the Lübeck neck and marches up the coastal spine as blue captures each field.

## Order of battle (see the yaml for exact sizes/callsigns)

**Blue** — Carrier CVN-75 (F/A-18E TARCAP/SEAD ×12, F/A-18F Strike/Anti-ship ×10, EA-18G ×6,
E-2D ×2, F/A-18E tanker ×3, SH-60B ×2) · **Nordholz (47)** F-22A ×12 + F-15E ×12 · **Bremen (5)**
E-3A / KC-135 ×2 / KC-135 MPRS ×2 / B-1B ×4 · **Hamburg (17)** A-10C Suite 7 ×8 / AH-64D ×4 /
CH-47F ×2 / C-130J ×2. ~56 combat aircraft.

**Red** — Copenhagen/Kastrup (41) Tu-22M3 anti-ship ×8 + Su-30 ×8 + IL-76 · Rostock/Laage (20)
MiG-31 ×8 + Su-27 ×8 · Peenemünde (25) Su-30 ×8 + Su-24M SEAD ×8 · Parchim (84) MiG-29S ×12 +
Su-25 ×8 · Wismar (108) [CH] Ka-52 ×4 + Mi-24P ×4 + Mi-8 ×4 · Szczecin (50) Tu-95MS ×4 + [CH]
Tu-160M2 ×4 + A-50 + IL-78 ×2 + Su-30 ×8 · Bornholm (33) MiG-29S ×8. ~60 aircraft, defensive
by design (offensive agency = Backfire anti-ship raids + §55 red-intent surges).

> **Airframe note (2026-07-20):** the Flankers are **vanilla `Su-30 Flanker-C`** and the
> interceptors **vanilla `MiG-31 Foxhound`** — NOT the mod `Su-30SM Flanker-H` /
> `MiG-31BM Foxhound`, whose mods (`su30_flanker_h`, `mig31bm_foxhound`) aren't on the curated
> wizard Mods page and would silently drop the squadron if absent (`remove_aircraft`, not
> substitute). Swap them back + preseed those two mods only if the DM confirms both are installed.

## IADS / SAM / coastal / naval belt (the signature)

Networked advanced IADS (`advanced_iads: true`, MANTIS range mode + per-base C2 statics). Built
to the SAM-belt STANDARD:
- **Strategic S-400 → regiment-by-authoring** (multi-battalion single-radar + shared EWR): hubs at Copenhagen `[127222, -500129]`, Rostock `[-46917, -547933]`,
  Szczecin `[-104437, -377931]`; `SA-20/PMU-1` mid nodes.
- **Coastal anti-ship wall** (`Bastion-P` + `BAL` LBASM, sea-facing — the CSG's gate): Rostock
  `[-21425, -544701]`, Kap Arkona/Rügen `[23897, -452187]`, Usedom `[-49529, -425779]`, Darß
  `[1512, -502398]`, Copenhagen `[131614, -490031]`.
- **Baltic Fleet SAG** (`Russian Navy`) at `[19397, -441610]` — CSG threat + hunt target.
- **Forward MERAD screen**: `SA-11`/`SA-17`/`BUK M3` + `SA-6` across the neck.
- **Point defense** every red base: `SA-15 Tor M2`/`Pantsir-S2`/`SA-19`. **EWR**: `55G6U`/`1L119`/`1L13`.
- **Blue base AD:** `Patriot` + `NASAMS 3` at Nordholz/Bremen; the CSG carries Aegis.
- **§49 SCUD hunt:** one coastal `SS-26 Iskander` at `[-70726, -537596]` (shoot-and-scoot).

## Phases & victory

- **§40 authored arc:** Rollback (*Break the Coastal Wall*) → Interdiction (*Clear the Baltic
  Coast*) → Offensive (*Force the Straits — Liberate Copenhagen*). A **Copenhagen positive-control
  no-strike circle** (`[133729, -489625]`, 22 nm) in phases 1–2, lifted in the offensive phase.
  `advance_when` accelerates on the enemy IADS falling past the min_turn floor.
- **§75 victory:** win = capture Copenhagen (`capture_cps: [Kastrup]`, min_turn 6); lose = lose
  the Nordholz bridgehead (`lose_cps: [Nordholz]`). Stock territory endings remain in addition.
- **Political will:** deliberately OFF (territory + §75 carries the ending).

## Preseeds & mods

`squadron_start_full`, `restrict_weapons_by_date` + `restrict_props_by_date` (2027 gate),
`restrict_weapons_by_stock`, cautious blue auto-planner (`ownfor_autoplanner_aggressiveness: 10`,
`oca_..._min_aircraft_count: 40`), `war_economy` + `fuel_air_readiness`, `red_intent`,
`c2_decapitation_effects`, `campaign_phases`, `convoy_ambush`,
`artillery_base_harassment` (removed 2026-09-16 with §36), `enemy_comms_jamming`, `host_red_scramble` (gated to
"Flash"). Plugins pinned: `skynetiads` (was `mantisiads` until 2026-09-12), `convoyambush`, `commsjam`,
`redscramble`, `vietnamops`, `combatsar`. **Mods:** `f22_raptor`, `fa_18efg`, `fa18ef_tanker`,
`usamilitaryassetspack`, `high_digit_sams`, `russianmilitaryassetspack`.

### The Modern Missiles mod — AMRAAM half ADOPTED, Sidewinder half REJECTED (2026-08-03)

> **⚠️ This section was rewritten the same day it was written. The first version rejected the mod

**The DM's goal, and it is historically correct:** the AIM-120D (now D-3) is the current US/allied
AMRAAM — the whole blue force fields it in real life — and this fork tops the entire blue fleet out
at **AIM-120C (2018)**. In a 2027 campaign that is the same anachronism as red's J-7B.

**There is no data-only path to it.** Measured across all 287 registered aircraft: exactly **four**
can mount a Retribution-visible AIM-120D store — **F-22A** (3 stores) and the CJS **FA-18E / FA-18F
/ EA-18G** (40 each). Nothing pylon-legal exists for the F-15C, F-16C or F/A-18C, so no yaml or
payload edit can reach them. The mod's in-place upgrade of the stock AIM-120 is the **only**
mechanism that does.

**Verdict: run `AAM_AIM_120D.cmd`, never `AAM_AIM_9X2.cmd`.** The scripts are fully independent —
the AMRAAM one copies only the AIM-120 texture, the AIM-120 shape, `aim120_family.lua` and the ME
icon. It **never touches `aim9_family.lua`**, which is where both of the serious objections lived:

* **The era breakage (point 2) is Sidewinder-only.** `AIM-120B` is dated 1994, so **Red Tide
  (1988) and Desert Storm (1991) field no AMRAAM at all** and are untouched by the AMRAAM swap.
  The original text named those two campaigns; that was the 9L→9X shift, not this.
* **The content deletion is Sidewinder-only.** The mod's year-old `aim9_family.lua` is missing
  **AIM-9D / AIM-9G / AIM-9H** (which `vwv_crusader.lua` frags). Its `aim120_family.lua` is
  missing **nothing** — a declaration diff against the live file returns exactly one entry, a
  LAU-115 rack *label* restyle, not a weapon.

**What the AMRAAM swap still costs, accepted knowingly:**

1. **It cannot be date-gated.** It keeps the stock clsid, so Retribution still sees "AIM-120B"
   (1994). Every campaign from 1994 to ~2018 that fields AMRAAMs silently flies D-model
   performance — that is the six pre-2019 pack campaigns (Clash of the Titans 2006, Vectron's Claw
   2005, Red Sea Rising 2005, The Anvil of War 2007, Vegas Nerve 2011, Desert Aladeen 2012).
   Mitigation is the OVGME toggle: enable for the modern campaigns (Baltic Fury, Marianas 2027),
   disable for period ones. There is no in-engine fix — invisibility to Retribution is inherent to
   an in-place swap.
2. **It reverts a year of ED AMRAAM tuning.** Mod copy 620 lines vs live 602, ~500 differing —
   no weapons lost, but ED's changes since 2.9.0 are. Re-check after any DCS or mod update; the
   mod ships `VERSION.txt 2.9.0` against a **2.9.28.26385** install.
3. **Breaks IC, needs MP lockstep** — every pilot on the server must match. OVGME makes that a
   click, but it is a real operational cost for events.
4. **Avionics still read AIM-120B** (the readme says so outright). Cosmetic.

**Still open (needs an in-game check before building):** whether to re-point the CJS Super Hornet
fits at the pack's own **"(Modern Missiles Mod Required)"** D stores, which *are* Retribution-visible
and already date-gated at 2019. The §71 `(XW)` `pylons_allow` pattern is the obvious mechanism, but
it **would not protect a mod-less host here**: those pylon entries are present even with the mod
absent (measured — 40 stores visible on FA-18E/F with the mod not applied), so the gate would pass
and the fallback would never fire. What a mod-less spawn actually does with that store is unknown
and must be flown before this is wired up.

---

**Original text (2026-08-03, superseded above).** Points 1 and 3 stand; point 2 is why the
Sidewinder script stays out:

1. **It is an in-place core-file swap, not an asset pack.** It overwrites `Bazar` / `CoreMods` /
   `MissionEditor` in the DCS install root via `.cmd` scripts, keeping the stock clsids — "the
   avionics for the aircraft will still show the old versions", "the mission editor labels them as
   AIM-120B's". So there is **nothing to register**: no `pydcs_extensions` module, no `ModSettings`
   toggle, no wizard checkbox, no faction edit. Retribution cannot see it, and therefore cannot
   gate it per campaign.
2. **It shifts the whole Sidewinder ladder one rung, globally** — "AIM-9L becomes AIM-9X", plus
   "performance improvements to the AIM-9M". `AIM-9L.yaml` is year 1976 and `AIM-9M.yaml` is 1982,
   so it silently defeats §24 date gating exactly where the fork can least afford it: **Red Tide**
   (1988-07-13) and **Desert Storm** (1991-01-17) both resolve 9L/9M as their top Sidewinder, and
   Red Tide is a shipped, flown, balanced build. Un-scoping it means every pilot runs
   `AAM_AIM_9L.cmd` between campaigns. It also breaks IC and needs MP version lockstep.
3. **The payoff here is near zero, because the capability is already in the two packs this
   campaign already requires.** The F-22A pack ships its own `{AIM-120D-3}` (self-contained, no
   annotation) and `F-22A.lua` already frags it in 12 fits; the CJS Super Hornet pack ships
   AIM-120D and AIM-9X2 stores.

**On re-pointing the Super Hornet fits at the pack's D/9X-2 stores.** Those come in two flavours:
the `*_AI` ones are labelled **"(AI Only)"**, and the player-usable ones are labelled
**"(Modern Missiles Mod Required)"** — i.e. the CJS pack declares this very mod as a dependency.
The original text ruled this out on the grounds that it would make the campaign require the mod;
**that objection dissolves once the mod is adopted deliberately** (see the verdict above), so it is
reopened as the "still open" item rather than a prohibition. It remains gated on an in-game check
of the mod-less case. Until then the Super Hornet fits stay on AIM-120C + AIM-9X.

#### Verified against the installed mod + the live DCS (2026-08-03, DM's machine)

The three points above were reasoned from the readme. They were then checked against the real
files at `E:\DCS World\OVGME MODS\Modern Missiles` — **all three hold verbatim** (the `.cmd`
swap scripts, the in-place overwrite of `Bazar/World/Shapes` + `CoreMods/aircraft/
AircraftWeaponPack/{aim9,aim120}_family.lua` + `MissionEditor/data/images`, the
"mission editor labels them as AIM-120B's" line, and "AIM-9L becomes AIM-9X"). No new clsids
anywhere: it edits ED's *existing* weapon families in place, which is exactly why Retribution
cannot see it.

**But reading the `.cmd` files is what corrected the verdict.** The scripts are **per missile
family and fully independent** — verbatim, `AAM_AIM_120D.cmd` copies exactly four things:

    Bazar\World\textures\AIM-120.zip
    Bazar\World\Shapes\aim-120b.edm
    CoreMods\aircraft\AircraftWeaponPack\aim120_family.lua
    MissionEditor\data\images\Loadout\Weapon\us_AIM-120B.png

`aim9_family.lua` appears **only** in `AAM_AIM_9X2.cmd` / `AAM_AIM_2000.cmd` /
`AAM_PYTHON_5.cmd` / `AAM_AIM_9L.cmd`. So "the mod" is not one decision — the AMRAAM upgrade and
the Sidewinder ladder shift are separately installable, and every objection that named a
Sidewinder is scoped to scripts we never run. (Each family also ships its own restore script:
`AAM_AIM_120B.cmd` returns the AMRAAM to stock, `AAM_AIM_9L.cmd` the Sidewinders.)

The mod is currently **not applied** on this install — verified by diffing the live weapon files
against both the mod's and the stock backups.

**The staleness finding — and why it condemns only the Sidewinder half.** The mod ships
`VERSION.txt = 2.9.0`; the install is **2.9.28.26385** (built 2026-07-28), and ED touched both
files it replaces within the last two weeks. The mod's copies are not a superset:

| File | Mod copy | Live | Delta | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aim9_family.lua` | 1501 lines | **1631** | **130 lines short**, 459 differ | ⛔ **deletes weapons** |
| `aim120_family.lua` | 620 lines | 602 | 500 differ | ✅ deletes nothing |
| `DLZ_Refference.lua` | ships a `Backup/` copy | **does not exist** | ED removed/renamed it | (backup only, never copied) |

Diffing the declarations, the live `aim9_family.lua` defines **AIM-9D, AIM-9G and AIM-9H** and
the mod's year-old copy **does not**. Those are the Vietnam-era Sidewinders, and this fork
depends on them directly: `resources/weapons/a2a-missiles/AIM-9{D,G,H}.yaml` register them
(1965 / 1970 / 1972) and `vwv_crusader.lua` + `vwv_crusader_np.lua` frag them on the F-8. So
running the **Sidewinder** script would remove the definitions out from under the Crusader fits,
and DCS silently strips a store it cannot resolve — the **F-8 flies naked**, the same failure mode
§71 documents for `(XW)` fits without their pylon injection.

**The same diff run on `aim120_family.lua` comes back clean:** exactly one live declaration is
absent from the mod's copy, and it is a `LAU-115: 2 x LAU-127 …` rack **label** restyle, not a
weapon. So the AMRAAM script loses ED's tuning but no content.

Bottom line: **`AAM_AIM_120D.cmd` is safe to run and is the only way to reach the rest of the blue
fleet; `AAM_AIM_9X2.cmd` must never be run on this install** until its author rebuilds against
current DCS. Re-check both line counts and re-run the declaration diff after any DCS or mod update
— the reason the AMRAAM half is safe is a *measurement*, not a property of the mod.

What *did* come out of the evaluation is a real data fix, applied fork-wide (see
`resources/weapons/a2a-missiles/AIM-120D.yaml`): the packs' AIM-120D / AIM-260A / AIM9X-BLKII /
Mako clsids were **unregistered**, so `register_unknown_weapons` gave them
`introduction_year=None` and `Weapon.available_on` treated them as always-available with no
fallback. Not academic — `F-22A.lua` frags `{AIM-120D-3}` in 12 fits and `{MAKO_A2A_C}` in **all
six** of the Raptor's `Retribution ...` fits, so every F-22A A2A sortie in the eleven campaigns
preseeding the pack carried an ungated AIM-120D and two ungated hypersonic AAMs — including
Clash of the Titans, set in **2006**. Now dated and laddered (C 2018 → D 2019 → 260A 2026 →
Mako 2027).

**AIM-260A is blue's top-end A2A missile — the Mako is cut (DM call 2026-08-03).** The pack's
own payloads put 2× Mako in all six of the Raptor's `Retribution ...` fits; those two stations
now carry **AIM-260A** instead (pylon-legal on stations 5 and 7 per the pack's own `Pylon5` /
`Pylon7` classes), so nothing Retribution plans frags a hypersonic in any campaign.

Mako stays **registered** rather than deleted, because deleting it is not neutral — the store is
still selectable in the payload editor, and an unregistered clsid is ungated in *every* era, so
dropping the file would put an ungated hypersonic back in a 2006 campaign the moment anyone
hand-loaded it. It keeps its 2027 date (after AIM-260A, the less mature of the two) and is simply
never auto-fragged. If the fork ever wants AIM-260A to be a ceiling even a hand-load can't beat,
park Mako's year past every shipped campaign — do not delete the file.

Verified end-to-end through the real `degrade_for_date` path on the Raptor's BARCAP fit:

| Campaign | Date | Raptor carries |
|---|---|---|
| Clash of the Titans | 2006 | 2× AIM-9M + 6× AIM-120B |
| Vegas Nerve | 2011 | 2× AIM-9M + 6× AIM-120B |
| Noisy Cricket | 2019 | 2× AIM-9X + 6× AIM-120D |
| **Baltic Fury / Marianas 2027** | 2027 | **2× AIM-9X + 4× AIM-120D + 2× AIM-260A** |

Guarded by `tests/test_modern_amraam_weapons.py`, which pins that no shipped fit frags Mako, that
the 2027 fit survives the date gate, and that Mako stays registered-and-gated.

## Miz generation (`tools/build_baltic_fury_miz.py`)

⚠️ **The miz is the source of truth — the script was a one-time bootstrap.** The DM built the
laydown out in the Mission Editor on 2026-07-20, so `resources/campaigns/operation_baltic_fury.miz`
is authoritative and `main()` **refuses to run** unless you pass `--force` (which would wipe those
edits, and no longer reproduces the bootstrap anyway — it rebuilds from a `red_tide.miz` that has
since moved on). Edit the miz in the ME. The tool's laydown tables are kept in sync with the miz
only so a hypothetical `--force` doesn't reintroduce known-bad placements. (This section used to
claim the opposite; corrected 2026-08-02.)

The bootstrap below is retained as the record of how the laydown was originally derived.

How it works (all conventions read straight from `game/campaignloader/mizcampaignloader.py`):

1. **CP ownership** — `ap.set_blue()` for Nordholz/Bremen/Hamburg, `ap.set_red()` for the 9 red
   fields (Kastrup/Laage/Peenemünde/Parchim/Wismar/Szczecin/Bornholm + the coastal-spine
   objectives Lübeck & Barth), `ap.set_neutral()` for the rest. GermanyCW has 227 airfields but
   only *touched* ones become CPs, so 3 red_tide-touched helipads (Bienenfarm, H FRG 09, H FRG 12)
   survive as **inert red-rear spares** (no squadrons; delete them in the ME if undesired). The
   only blue↔red route is Hamburg→Lübeck, so the FLOT starts at the neck.
2. **Vanilla band markers** — the faction supplies the real mod (CH/HDS) units at generation, so
   the miz stays 100 % vanilla and round-trips through pydcs losslessly. Marker → band:
   `S_300PS_5P85C_ln`→LORAD (S-400), `S_75M_Volhov`→MERAD, `Strela_1_9P31`→SHORAD,
   `x_1L13_EWR`→EWR, `Vulcan`→blue AAA, `MissilesSS.hy_launcher`→coastal anti-ship,
   `MissilesSS.Scud_B`→§49 missile.
3. **Carrier** — a blue `Stennis` ship group named `CVN-75 Harry S. Truman` (the yaml keys the
   wing by that string; drives the §65 comms card). **Fleet SAG** — 3 red `USS_Arleigh_Burke_IIa`
   marker hulls (the loader's naval-target type; faction navy fills in).
4. **Advanced-IADS C2** — `_Command_Center` + `Comms_tower_M` + `GeneratorF` statics co-located at
   each of 4 red hubs (Copenhagen/Rostock/Szczecin/Peenemünde) — the cells §51/§52 key on.
5. **Economy** — `Workshop_A` (factory) + `_Ammunition_depot` (ammo), blue at Bremen/Hamburg, red
   at Rostock/Peenemünde/Copenhagen/Szczecin.
6. **Trigger zones cleared** — Red Tide's scenery/influence zones (named after its CPs, e.g.
   `Haina`) are dropped so the loader's preset-location pass doesn't look up dead control points.

**Finish:** load a New Game (mods enabled) → eyeball top-down (FLOT at the neck, carrier offshore,
belt where intended) → CI test + doc sync. The mods must be enabled for faction/TGO resolution;
headless `load_theater` validates structure but not the mod-backed generation.

## Never author at a control point's raw coordinate (fixed 2026-08-02)

An `Airfield` control point's `position` **is** the DCS airfield reference point — the same point
pydcs uses for a `StartType.Runway` spawn — so anything authored at the raw CP coordinate is put
**on the runway**. The bootstrap's economy/defense tables did exactly that. The DM's ME pass had
already moved the factories and AAA (0.9–3.4 km off their fields), but the **three ammunition
depots were missed** and sat at 0 m from the Hamburg, Peenemünde and Szczecin references. They are
now 1.5 km off each field, on land, on a bearing ≥30° away from every supply road leaving that base
(so they never collide with a convoy forming up). `tools/build_baltic_fury_miz.py`'s tables were
synced to the miz's real positions and carry a warning; the invariant is CI-locked by
`test_no_preset_marker_sits_on_a_runway` in `tests/retlab/test_baltic_fury.py` (no preset
marker within 500 m of an airfield reference).

The **supply routes** have the same anchoring — all 10 `supply_routes:` endpoints in the yaml sit
on their airfield reference to under 1 m, which parked every departing convoy on the runway. That
half is fixed **engine-side** rather than in the yaml (see features doc §8, `ConvoyGenerator`):
the generator walks a convoy's spawn back out along the authored corridor until it is 1.5 km clear
of the field, which fixes existing saves on the next regeneration and covers every campaign — Red
Tide has 3 endpoints with the same defect.

### Open: the Peenemünde routes cross open water

Found while fixing the above, **not fixed**. Both supply routes touching Peenemünde run as straight
lines across the Peenestrom/Achterwasser rather than following roads — the first 5 km of the
Peenemünde→Neubrandenburg leg and 6 of the first 8 km of Peenemünde→Szczecin are water. A red
convoy on either would try to drive across a strait. The spawn guard degrades safely here (no land
inside its walk budget ⇒ it leaves the spawn where authored, i.e. no worse than today), but the
routes themselves need a real road re-trace per the "supply lines follow the driveable corridor"
standard (`tools/supply_route_geo.py`).
