## What runs now — upstream #929

**#929 is an OPEN upstream PR, not merged.** As of 2026-08-17 it has 34 commits, zero submitted
reviews, and `mergeable_state=blocked`. One comment (juanjux, 2026-08-10) says it is too big to
review and he will test it in his own fork. It answers upstream issue #104, which is one of the
six things still open on the v1.6 milestone.

So the fork is running an unreviewed upstream branch as its rescue system. That is a deliberate
call — the alternative was keeping a §21 the squadron had already rejected — but it means **#929
changing is a normal event, not an exception**, and every phase it gains has to be re-adopted by
hand. Track it: `gh api repos/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution/pulls/929/commits`.

Adoption log:

| Date | Upstream state | What we took |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07 | head `9f7d5edc` | The whole feature (RetLab#805). Two defects found by reading and fixed on the way in: the survivor beacon named a file that exists nowhere in the tree, and the pickup waypoint briefed a hover above MOOSE's winch ceiling. |
| 2026-08-17 | commit `82b3ab10` | Phase 5, in full. See below. |
| 2026-09-13 | head `12e340f7` | **Nothing taken; a defect found on test 30 and fixed fork-side.** The landing-after-ejection handler refined "the most recent ejection without a landing". DCS fires one landing per crew member, so a two-seat crew's second touchdown was written onto another survivor: an AV-8B pilot down in the Strait of Hormuz was recorded 170 km away beside an F-4E's crash. Now `landing_ejection_for` takes the nearest open ejection within 20 km and drops a landing that matches nothing (`tests/lua/test_dcs_retribution_runtime.py`). #929's head carries the same loop — report it on the thread (inventory item 38). Checklist B122. |
| 2026-08-30 | commit `687cb3ee` | The AI-rescue fallback guard. We carried the bug byte-identically. **Not taken:** commit `2abd88e8`, which surfaces this turn's captures in the debrief — a feature, not a defect, and it lands on `debriefing.py` / `QDebriefingWindow.py` where §4 and §29 live. |

### The AI-rescue fallback credited flights the mission had already answered (2026-08-30)

`commit_csar_results` resolves rescues in two passes: Ops.CSAR pickups in `state.json` are
authoritative, and a fallback credits a surviving AI CSAR flight that targeted a downed pilot.
The fallback had no test for whether the flight was **in the mission at all**.

So an AI CSAR flight that was generated, flew, and came home without completing the pickup was
credited with the rescue anyway — Ops.CSAR's silence was read as "no report" instead of "reported
nothing". Two consequences:

- Rescues are invented. The pilot returns to recovery having never been picked up.
- The debrief disagrees with the in-progress screen, which is rendered *before* results commit and
  so can never see a fallback rescue.

The fix is one set and one guard: `flown` is every flight in `debriefing.unit_map.aircraft`, and a
flight in it skips the fallback. What remains is exactly the case the fallback exists for — flights
the simulation resolved *before* the `.miz` was generated, which never had a chance to report. That
branch now logs when it fires, because it is the only path that can produce the disagreement above.

Adopted from upstream #929 commit `687cb3ee`. Three tests in `tests/test_csar.py`
(`test_simulated_ai_flight_rescues_via_the_fallback`,
`test_flown_ai_flight_needs_the_mission_to_confirm_the_rescue`,
`test_flown_ai_flight_is_credited_when_the_mission_confirms_it`).

**Watch on the next CSAR fly:** a rescue count in the debrief that exceeds what the in-progress
screen showed now means the pre-generation branch fired, and the log line names the pilot. Before
this fix it meant nothing at all.

### The Sandy — the rescue escort, rebuilt (2026-09-11)

The A-10 and the Apache can be fragged onto a survivor as **`FlightType.SANDY`**: an armed
track centred on the pilot, covering the pickup while the helicopter works. Engineering
detail is [retlab-features.md §99](../retlab-features.md#99--sandy-rescue-escort).

Read this before assuming it is §15 restored. It is not. §15 was a `FlightType.SCAR` with a
`scar` plugin, a scenario runtime and its own HTN tasks, and it was removed with the rest of
the fork's rescue stack on 2026-08-07. What is back is the *role*, on the smallest
architecture that can carry it: a flight plan, a task on six aircraft yamls, and a callsign.
Nothing from the deleted feature was restored, and the eight deleted SCAR/CSAR notes stay
deleted.

Three things about it that are decisions, not defaults:

- **Hand-fragged only.** Nothing in the HTN proposes a `SANDY`, so the auto-planner cannot
  frag one whatever a squadron's auto-assignable set says; `secondary_tasks` on the six
  airframes keeps the checkbox unticked as well. Same call as the King, for a different
  reason: an AI King *cannot* finish the job, an AI Sandy simply would not be doing one.
- **Capability is the yaml, not a preference.** The §77 `ESCORT_JAMMER` pattern. This is the
  whole reason it needed a flight type instead of a CAS flight dispatched on its target —
  a `preferred_type` would have left every CAS jet in the wing eligible.
- **It shares nothing with the rescue flight but the target.** No handshake, no timing tie,
  no "Sandy cleared me in". If that is ever wanted it is new work, and the place to put it
  is the package, not the flight plan.

### The King's on-scene systems (2026-09-12)

The King can now do the two things the role exists for: **find the survivor** and **tell the
rescue what is around them**. Engineering detail is
[retlab-features.md §100](../retlab-features.md#100--king-on-scene-commander).

Three decisions, each asked and answered on 2026-09-12:

- **The fix is DF cuts, not a proximity reveal.** One cut is a bearing. Two cuts from
  positions ≥15° apart make a fix whose error is a function of the geometry — flying an arc
  is what tightens it. Inside 15 nm with line of sight the pod has the survivor and the fix
  is exact. Rejected: "inside 30 nm one press drops a mark" — simpler, but it rewards nothing.
- **Threats are a class and a rough position.** SAM / AAA / MANPADS / armour / troops, bearing
  and range from the survivor, marks jittered ~0.25 nm. Rejected: exact type and point — it
  reveals composition the fog would hide and makes the King a targeting pod, not a cue.
- **Players only.** The picture goes to player-crewed Sandy and helicopter groups. Nothing is
  pushed onto an AI flight. Rejected: vectoring AI Sandys onto the top threat — real King
  behaviour, but a task push replaces the flight's route, which is the §15 divert lesson.

It lives in the `opscsar` plugin as a second script rather than in the C-130J EW plugin.
**One or the other** (DM call 2026-09-12): a CSAR C-130J gets the on-scene menu and is on
the EW plugin's deny-list; a JAMMING C-130J gets EW/ISR and no on-scene menu. The Python
deny-list had never actually listed CSAR, whatever the Lua comment said; it does now.

### The King — fixed-wing CSAR (2026-08-26)

The C-130J carries an explicit `CSAR: 5` in its yaml so a player can fly the on-scene
commander. Three places said that was supported — the yaml, `Squadron.can_auto_assign_mission`
("the player may still frag one by hand") and `tests/test_csar.py` — and one made it
impossible: `CsarFlightPlan.Builder.layout()` raised for any non-helo, which killed the
hand-fragged King exactly as dead as an auto-planned one. The player got "Could not create
flight" after picking their survivor, airframe and squadron, and the README had been
advertising the role since 2026-08-07.

Fixed-wing CSAR now dispatches to **`KingFlightPlan`** (`game/ato/flightplans/king.py`), a
`PatrollingFlightPlan` racetrack. Same shape the C-130J's JAMMING task already flies — that
task maps to `AewcFlightPlan` for the same reason.

- **The dispatch is in `FlightPlanBuilderTypes.for_flight`**, an early return next to the
  REFUELING one. `CsarFlightPlan` stays helicopter-only and still raises; the King simply
  never reaches it. Nothing about upstream's helicopter rule was relaxed, which is what the
  yaml's own comment demands.
- **The auto-planner gate is untouched.** `FlightType.requires_helicopter` and
  `can_auto_assign_mission` still keep the King off the planner, and `CSAR: 5` is still the
  lowest CSAR number in the fleet. An AI-crewed King cannot finish a pickup and must never be
  fragged for one; that was never the bug.
- **Geometry.** The orbit anchors on the survivor: 15 nm off on the side away from the nearest
  threat, closing to as little as 5 nm when the threat crowds it, and pushed to
  `distance_to_boundary + 10 nm` when the survivor is inside a ring. Legs run tangential
  (10 nm each side of centre) so the King holds one distance instead of driving in and out.
  All four branches are pinned in `tests/ato/flightplans/test_king.py`.
- **Constants are hardcoded, not settings.** The flight is hand-fragged, so the player who
  wants a different orbit moves the waypoints.

**Not verified in DCS — checklist B106.** The flight still spawns through
`configure_transport` (main task `Transport`, ROE weapon-hold), and no headless test can say
whether a Transport-tasked C-130 flies a `ControlledTask` racetrack. If it does not, the fix
is a King-specific branch in `aircraftbehavior.py`, not a change to this plan.

### Phase 5 (upstream `82b3ab10`, adopted 2026-08-17)

+680/−35 across 11 files, all of them files we already carried. Five behaviours:

- **Cluster pickups.** Survivors within `csar_cluster_radius` (default 1000 m) come out on one
  lift instead of one flight each. The planner takes the whole cluster off the board,
  `EmbarkToTransport`'s zone stretches to the furthest member, and OpsCSAR.lua rebuilds the
  cluster at runtime rather than trusting an injected list — so a mate already killed or
  collected does not get credited.
- **Control-point radius.** A pilot who comes down within `csar_control_point_radius` (default
  15 nm) of a base generates no rescue at all: friendly ground means they walk back and go into
  recovery, enemy ground means they are captured.
- **Prisoners are freed by capturing the base holding them.** `Pilot.held_at` persists the
  captor's control point; retaking it releases the pilot into recovery.
- **`csar_single_flight`** plans one helicopter instead of a pair.
- **`csar_player_hover_height` / `csar_player_hover_distance`** feed Ops.CSAR's
  `rescuehoverheight` / `rescuehoverdistance`.

**One fork adaptation was required, and it is the reason to read this section before touching the
hover.** Our 2026-08-07 fix pinned the briefed hover at 50 ft against MOOSE's hardcoded 20 m
winch ceiling, guarded by a test that parsed that 20 out of `Moose.lua`. Phase 5 makes the ceiling
a **setting** spanning 5–100 m, so a fixed briefed altitude is only safe at the default and the
original defect reopens at the bottom of the range — with the guard test still passing, because it
was watching the wrong number. `briefed_hover_altitude()` now clamps to
`HOVER_CEILING_FRACTION` (0.8) of the setting, and both callers — the waypoint and the Lua
config — go through it. At the 20 m default the clamp does not bind, so the flown value is still
50 ft and nothing changes for anyone who leaves the setting alone.

`Moose.lua` is still parsed by the guard test, for the two things the setting cannot tell us: that
`rescuehoverheight` still exists under that name (OpsCSAR.lua assigns to it, and a rename would
fail silently), and that MOOSE's own default has not drifted away from the setting's.

The Lua hunks did **not** apply — `OpsCSAR.lua` carries RetLab beacon-channel pin — and were
hand-ported. Upstream's cluster-credit loop went onto the takeoff path only; the fork's two extra
`"embarked on"` sites detect each survivor vanishing individually and already credit mates on
their own.

**The pin reached only half the survivors until 2026-09-16.** `register_with_ops_csar` (the
plugin's path for pilots Retribution places at mission start) used `beaconHz` directly, but a
pilot who ejects during the mission is registered by MOOSE's own `CSAR:_AddCsar`, which draws
from its random pool: the 2026-09-16 audit found test 33's two blue survivors on 620 and 820 kHz
and test 24's eighteen blue beacons never on 260, while every pre-placed survivor keyed 260. The
plugin now overrides `_GenerateADFFrequency` on each Ops.CSAR instance to return the pinned
channel, so both paths agree with the kneeboard. Guarded by
`tests/test_plugin_resource_files.py::test_the_csar_beacon_pin_reaches_in_mission_ejections`.

## The point (the user's vision, locked 2026-06-27)

> "I want the system to work where it's auto-fragged for AI to go pick up AIs and players can
> drop in if they wish. **Just a normal task.**"

Pilot goes down → everyone knows → somebody (AI or player) goes and gets him → the campaign
remembers. Everything below serves that; anything that doesn't is out.

## The 2026-07-03 rescope (squadron call — the course-correct)

A wide review found the feature had been stacked, rebuilt, and reshifted past its point: three
flight types, a 978-line plugin, eight design docs, eleven checklist rows — and the one thing
the vision asked for (default ON) never shipped. The call:

1. **Default ON.** `auto_combat_sar` now defaults ON for new campaigns (existing saves keep
   their stored choice). Rescue is a normal task.
2. **The AI-drama layer is FROZEN.** The Sandy auto-divert (G23) gets its one owed re-fly of
   the 2026-07-02 route-push rework: pass → it stays, frozen; fail → delete the divert (a
   player Sandy is untouched either way). No further iteration on AI-performs-the-rescue
   choreography — player-facing findability (smoke, F10 marks, LARS) is where investment goes.
3. **The POW recovery raid is SHELVED.** Capture is a campaign *consequence*, not a plannable
   mission. Removed: the `CSAR` raid flight type (persisted saves degrade it to TRANSPORT via
   `_LEGACY_FLIGHT_TYPE_VALUES`), the dynamic `CapturedPilotGroundObject` map objective (class
   kept as a save-compat tombstone; `purge_pow_objectives` sweeps old saves), and
   `commit_pow_recoveries`. **Kept — the held-POW model** (expanded 2026-07-06, see below): a
   captured pilot becomes a `PendingPowRecovery` held at the nearest enemy field (resolved at
   capture time), **freed if that field falls**, and **draining political will every turn held**
   (the Vietnam W1 feed — this is why the ledger stays).
4. **One doc.** This file. The old eight are historical record only.

## POW mechanics rework (2026-07-06)

Follow-up on the §51 comms-jamming intel gate (which made "a held POW compromises your comms"
a real consequence): a survey of the POW path found three gaps, all now fixed.

1. **A captured pilot was still flyable.** `PilotStatus` had only Active/OnLeave/Dead, and the
   squadron rebuilds its available pool from *Active* pilots — so the aviator in Hanoi could be
   fragged next turn while also draining will and compromising comms. New **`PilotStatus.POW`**:
   `record_pow_captures` calls `pilot.capture()` (Active → POW; `alive` stays True), which drops
   them from `active_pilots` (scheduling + the available-pool rebuild) until recovered. Freeing
   sets them back Active (`repatriate()`).
2. **POWs were invisible.** Nothing surfaced a held POW after the capture message. Now a
   **SITREP band line** per POW — `"Capt Mitchell — held at Mozdok (2 turns left)"`, or
   `"(held)"` on an indefinite-hold will campaign — and the **squadron roster** shows the POW
   status. The two levers (recapture the field / the clock) are finally legible, on every
   campaign (the SITREP works without the will meter).
3. **The 4-turn death clock was era-wrong on will campaigns and self-cauterized the running
   sore.** §48 made the per-turn POW drain "the one lever the GCI-ambush enemy has to pressure
   Washington" — but the pilot was killed after 4 turns, stopping the bleed. Now
   **`surviving_pows` holds indefinitely when `vietnam_political_will` is on** (the drain
   continues until freed or the war ends); non-will campaigns keep the 4-turn clock. The
   **Homecoming**: `resolve_pows_at_game_end` (from `process_win_loss`) repatriates every held
   blue POW on a negotiated **win** (a felt payoff) and writes them off on a withdrawal **loss**.

**Built on the existing pilot-mortality setting.** Every POW write-off (clock expiry *and* the
loss-ending) routes through `_write_off`, which respects `invulnerable_player_pilots` exactly
like the other kill paths: the player's own POW is **repatriated** rather than killed; an AI POW
is a permanent loss. This also fixed a latent bug — the old `surviving_pows` killed a player's
captured pilot at clock expiry even with invulnerable pilots set.

**§51 coupling stays honest.** "POW held = comms compromised" is time-boxed to
`COMMS_COMPROMISE_TURNS` (4) via a `captured_turn` stamp, so an indefinitely-held POW does not
jam the net forever — the squadron rotates its comms plan after a few turns even while the pilot
is still captive.

Files: `game/squadrons/pilot.py` (the POW status/`capture`/`repatriate`), `game/pow_recovery.py`
(`surviving_pows` will-awareness + `_write_off` + `resolve_pows_at_game_end`),
`game/sim/missionresultsprocessor.py` (capture flips status + stamps turn; the SITREP POW
lines), `game/game.py` (`process_win_loss` Homecoming), `game/sitrep.py` (`pows_held`),
`qt_ui/windows/SquadronDialog.py` (roster status), `game/missiongenerator/commsjamluadata.py`
(the compromise expiry). Tests: ~~`tests/test_pow_recovery.py`~~,
`tests/squadrons/test_squadron_pilots.py`, `tests/test_sitrep.py`,
`tests/missiongenerator/test_commsjamluadata.py`. In-game pass: checklist G28. **Not shipped**
(unchanged from the rescope): the POW recovery raid stays shelved, red-side POWs stay out.

## On-demand rescue rework (2026-07-06) — the standing orbit is retired

The 2026-07-03 rescope kept the standing orbit + froze the AI-drama layer. A flown Inherent
Resolve session (`jovial-gates-574c9c`) then showed the orbit model does not work: two pilots
ejected, and the orbiting rescue helo the runtime tried to **commandeer** never flew the
pickup — it finished its racetrack and RTB'd to its homebase (checklist G21). Re-tasking an
already-airborne, already-routed group to a rescue is the thing that fails; **spawning fresh
into the rescue mission** (the clone path) is the thing that works.

So the user re-directed the model (squadron call): **make CSAR a plannable human package, and
replace the standing orbit with an on-demand AI rescue that spawns only when nobody fragged
one.** Three scenarios: (A) human in the King, AI in the other seats → don't spawn extra; (B)
full human package → don't spawn; (C) no package, players on the front line → spawn an AI
rescue to go get the downed pilot.

**What landed (v1):**
- **The standing orbit is removed.** `PlanCombatSar` / `PlanCombatSarSupport` /
  `combat_sar_targets` are gone; `auto_combat_sar` no longer auto-frags an orbiting package.
- **Player-plannable package** already existed and stays — `FrontLine.mission_types` offers
  `COMBAT_SAR` + `SCAR`, so a player builds a C-130 + helo(s) + A-10 Sandys off the FLOT.
- **On-demand AI rescue — parked-first, clone-fallback.** When a pilot goes down with no player
  package up, the runtime rescues from, in preference order:
  1. a **real untasked rescue helo parked cold on the ramp** — Retribution already spawns each
     squadron's spare airframes via `_spawn_unused_for` → `create_idle_aircraft` (uncontrolled,
     **and added to the `UnitMap`**). `spawn_combat_sar_templates` collects the BLUE CSAR-capable
     ones (`mission_data.parked_rescue_helos`); the plugin starts one in place
     (`StartUncontrolled`) and flies the OPSTRANSPORT pickup. Because it's a real `UnitMap`
     airframe, **its loss is recorded** — the tracked source. This is the user's insight (the
     armed C-130s/A-10s/helos already on the ramp) applied to the helo.
  2. a **cold late-activation clone template** (the QRA `spawn_intercept_templates` pattern) as the
     fallback when the ramp is bare (`perf_disable_untasked_blufor_aircraft`, or a fully-tasked
     wing) — SPAWN-cloned; the clone is **untracked**, like the pre-rework rescue clones.

  Both go straight into the pickup (the clone-into-mission path that works). **Why parked and not
  the old commandeer:** the retired dispatch commandeered an *airborne, already-routed* orbit helo,
  which RTB'd instead of rescuing (G21). A *parked* start is much closer to "fresh into mission" —
  the thing that works. BLUE only.
- **The gate (narrowed 2026-07-15):** only a **rescue-capable** player flight — a CSAR **helo**
  in the ATO — ⟹ `autoSpawn=false` (no AI spawn; the player's helo + ledger handle it). A bare
  Sandy (SCAR) or King (fixed-wing CSAR) does NOT suppress: neither can pick anyone up, so it
  **draws** the AI helo and escorts/tracks it. Nothing fragged ⟹ `autoSpawn=true`. Emitted as
  `dcsRetribution.CombatSAR.autoSpawn` + `parkedHelos` (preferred) + `heloTemplate`/`farp` (fallback).
  *History:* the original 2026-07-06 gate counted ANY CSAR/SCAR flight as "we've got it covered" —
  the flown Red Tide M1 (2026-07-11) then showed one bare player Sandy silently disabling ALL
  rescue for the mission (`0 King(s), 1 Sandy(s), … AI-rescue off` in the ledger log), which is
  what the narrowing fixes (squadron call 2026-07-15).

**Deferred (v2, clearly marked so nobody assumes it shipped):**
- On-demand **Sandy + King** launches. The helo needs no loadout (it does OPSTRANSPORT), but a
  Sandy needs an armed payload (the configurator pass — neither a parked untasked airframe nor a
  cold template carries weapons: both are generated `maintask=None` / clean-wing) and a King needs
  its TACAN-beacon setup (`register_combat_sar_king`, only run for tasked King flights). So v1
  fields the essential rescuer only.
- **Multi-survivor chaining** ("grab the other guy on the way") — OPSTRANSPORT multi-cargo, once
  the core is flown.

## Packaged AI-helo auto-pickup + weapons-free Sandy (2026-07-30 flown fix)

Previously deferred, now **implemented** off a flown finding. The player fragged a full recovery
package — a CH-47D rescue helo + an AH-1W Sandy + a C-130 King — and flew the King himself,
leaving the CH-47 and the Sandy AI-crewed. Both misbehaved (Tacview + the emitted config +
the ledger log `1 King, 1 Sandy, capture on, AI-rescue off`):

- **The CH-47 flew its planned CSAR orbit and never approached the pilot** (never closer than
  23 km). With `autoSpawn` **off** (a rescue-capable helo *was* fragged), the only rescue path
  was the geometry pickup (`findBoardingHelo`) — which merely *detects* a helo a human has already
  flown low+slow onto the survivor. Nothing ever **routed** the AI CH-47.
- **The AH-1W Sandy "flew straight and level without fighting back."** `configure_scar` generates
  the Sandy with ROE **Open Fire** (engage *designated* targets only), so it would not return fire
  at an attacker that wasn't its designated target.

The fix (in `combatsar-config.lua`, no Python/emit change):

1. **`commandeerRescueHelo(cfg, coord)`** — finds the nearest alive, **AI-crewed** (not
   player-flown, `groupHasPlayer`) rescue helo in `cfg.rescueHelos`. `dispatchAIRescue` now tries
   it FIRST (source order: package rescue helo → parked ramp helo → clone template), and the tick
   dispatch gate fires when `autoSpawn` is on **or** an AI-crewed rescue helo is commandeerable —
   so a player package with an AI helo gets an active OPSTRANSPORT pickup, exactly like the
   on-demand path. An **airborne** package helo is commandeered without `StartUncontrolled` (only
   the cold parked helo needs the start). A **player-crewed** rescue helo is left alone — the human
   flies it and the geometry path credits it. The delivery-field resolution no longer requires
   `cfg.farp` (absent for a player package): it falls back to the nearest resolvable friendly field.
2. **`setAirWeaponsFree(groupName)`** — a diverted Sandy is set **WEAPON_FREE** (Air ROE) so it
   actually prosecutes the snatch party / nearby threats instead of ignoring them.

This is still the commandeer-an-airborne-helo path the earlier note flagged as risky (G21) — but
via `FLIGHTGROUP:AddOpsTransport` (the proven AICSAR routing), **not** the retired `SetTask`
commandeer that RTB'd. Harness-locked in ~~`tests/lua/test_combatsar_ai_rescue_dispatch.py`~~ (the
AI-crewed helo IS commandeered, a player-crewed one is NOT). **The actual OPSTRANSPORT flying +
delivery still ride an in-game re-fly** (checklist G9/G23).

**The fly-critical unknown:** the parked-helo *start-in-place* path (`GROUP:StartUncontrolled()` +
`FLIGHTGROUP:AddOpsTransport`) is a runtime path I can't verify headlessly — likely fine, but
unproven. It degrades safely: if a parked helo is commandeered but never launches, that survivor
isn't rescued that dispatch; the clone fallback covers the no-parked case. If the fly shows the
start-in-place doesn't work, make the clone primary.

task is gone + the parked pool / cold template is generated at start).

## Runtime hardening — snatch-party safety cap + ledger cleanup (2026-07-09)

Diagnosed from a user `dcs.log`: a heavy Red Tide (Germany Cold War) mission **hung** ~13 min in
— the log stopped mid-flood of MOOSE `UNIT.GetVec3` / `GROUP.GetCoordinate` errors with **no
crash dump** (a scripting/sim-thread hang, not a CTD; the 20-core / 130 GB rig was never the
limit — DCS runs scripting + the sim on one thread). Root cause: the enemy **capture race** had
spawned **8 snatch parties of 10 = 80 infantry** across two ejections. The plugin default is
5 infantry / 3 teams, but a **saved plugin-option override** (~40 / 4) was in force, so every
ejection dumped 40 real ground units — the dominant dynamic-spawn source — onto an already-heavy
plugin stack (MANTIS over 62 AD groups + TIC/GLSCO + SplashDamage + airbase harassment + TARS),
and the single-threaded sim bogged until it locked. Two fixes:

1. **Hard safety cap.** After the option parse, `capturePartySize` / `captureTeams` are clamped to
   `MAX_PARTY_SIZE` 12 / `MAX_TEAMS` 4 (floored at 1), warning once when a value is reined in. The
   capture race can no longer be the thing that freezes the sim regardless of a cranked or
   stale-saved value; the shipped defaults sit well inside the cap. plugin.json labels state both
   caps.
2. **Dead-reference cleanup** (the `GetVec3`/`GetCoordinate` flood was MOOSE polling dead DCS
   objects): `advanceCapture` now **prunes killed teams** out of `entry.party` each cycle (the
   per-poll scan shrinks as the party is attrited instead of re-scanning the full original list
   forever) and reads positions via a new `firstAliveCoord` helper (first *living* unit's
   coordinate, pcall-guarded — never calls `GetCoordinate` on a group whose lead unit is dead,
   which otherwise logged every poll). The main `tick` also **reaps a downed pilot killed on the
   ground** by finally assigning the designed-but-unused `dead` state — previously a pilot killed
   while `down` (never rescued, never captured) lingered in the ledger forever and had its dead
   group polled every 5 s.

`firstAliveCoord` also backs `findBoardingHelo`'s survivor read. Behavioral test:
~~`tests/lua/test_combatsar_capture_cap.py`~~ runs the **real** plugin under Lua 5.1 with a cranked
config and asserts the clamp fires with the right numbers (combatsar is MOOSE-heavy and not in
the `DcsPluginHarness`, but the cap runs at file scope before any MOOSE wiring, so a tiny sandbox
drives it end to end). No `.miz` / save / New-Game requirement — it's a plugin-runtime fix that
takes effect on the next mission generation.

## What ships (the architecture that survived)

**Two flight types:**
- `COMBAT_SAR` — the rescue helo (CH-47/UH-1…) + the HC-130 "King" (air-tracking TACAN + the LARS
  F10 survivor locator). **Player-planned** off the FLOT, or spawned **on demand** by the runtime
  when no player package is up (the 2026-07-06 rework above; the standing orbit is retired). BLUE
  only — red flies NO CSAR, squadron call 2026-07-01.
- `SCAR` — the "Sandy" rescue escort (A-10/AH-64) in that package; protects the survivor,
  kills the snatch party, walks the helo in. Player-first; the AI divert (frozen G23) now applies
  only to a player-package's AI-crewed Sandy (no orbit to divert from in the AI-spawn path).

**The survivor ledger** (`resources/plugins/combatsar/combatsar-config.lua` — Route 1, the one
source of truth): every ejection registers a survivor (red smoke + mayday); player and AI
rescues are judged by the same land-near/low-slow geometry; a delivered survivor appends the
real airframe unit name to `combat_sar_rescues` (the pilot is spared at debrief — G11
verified); the opposing side may spawn a dispersed snatch party (G20 verified) and a party
holding on the pilot long enough CAPTURES them → `combat_sar_captures` → the held-POW model
above. AI dispatch **clones the cold rescue template into the mission** (the 2026-07-06 rework —
the old commandeer-the-orbit path is retired with the orbit; G21).

**AI-rescue delivery field (fixed 2026-07-03, flown Yankee Station):** the AI dispatch needs a
delivery airbase resolved via MOOSE `AIRBASE:FindByName`. Python passes the King's departure
*control-point display name* (`rescue_flights[0].departure.airfield_name`, `luagenerator.py`),
which matches a real airfield's DCS name but **not** a generated FARP — whose DCS object is
`"<CP> FARP 0"` (`tgogenerator.create_helipad`). So a FARP-based King (the Vietnam FOB case)
logged `combatsar: AI dispatch - FARP '<CP>' not found` on every ejection and never delivered.
`dispatchAIRescue` now falls back to `nearestFriendlyAirbaseObject` — the closest friendly field
MOOSE *can* resolve to the survivor — when the configured name misses (airbase-based Kings keep
their exact field; only the previously-broken FARP path changes). Consistent with the feature's
"deliver to ANY friendly field" contract. Needs a re-fly to confirm the AI actually completes the
delivery (G21/G23).

**Python side:** `game/pow_recovery.py` (the held-POW model + the tombstone purge),
`record_pow_captures` / `commit_air_losses` in `missionresultsprocessor.py` (scoring),
`game/missiongenerator/aircraft/aircraftgenerator.py` (`spawn_combat_sar_templates`, the
on-demand rescue). `game/ato/flightplans/combatsar.py` (the forward hold) is now only used by a
**player-planned** COMBAT_SAR flight — the standing-orbit auto-frag (`PlanCombatSar`) is deleted.
Save-compat tombstones for the retired SOF economy live in `game/scar_rescue.py`.

## Testing aids — thumb on the scale (2026-07-09)

A flown session left **both** downed pilots unresolved (no pickup, no capture), so G10/G23/G28
and the capture-gated §51 comms jamming (S4) all went unexercised end-to-end. Two problems: the
AI rescue is the flaky path, and a capture essentially never completes — the snatch party spawned
**2 NM** out and walked in at ~5.5 m/s (~11-min march, easily killed or simply out of the mission
window). Fixes:

- **Real tuning:** the snatch-party spawn default drops **2 NM → 0.75 NM** (`captureSpawnDistanceNm`
  in `plugin.json` + the Lua `capture.spawnDistance` fallback). ~4-min approach, still killable by a
  Sandy — a capture is now a real, occasional outcome in normal play instead of ~never. NEW game (or
  set the option) to take effect.
- **Two test toggles** (Settings → Campaign Management → HQ Automation, both **default OFF**), emitted
  as scalar flags on `dcsRetribution.CombatSAR` and honored by the plugin (applied *after* the normal
  options; force-capture wins if both set):
  - `combat_sar_test_force_capture` → `testForceCapture`: capture on, chance 100%, spawn 0.2 NM, seize
    radius 1000 ft, dwell 5 s. Every ejection → a fast, guaranteed **capture → POW**, which unlocks the
    capture-gated comms jam. The reliable way to exercise **G28 + S4**.
  - `combat_sar_test_easy_rescue` → `testEasyRescue`: capture off, pickup range 2000 ft / AGL 300 ft /
    speed 80 kt / delivery 3 NM, AI dispatch 30 s. A rough landing near the smoke boards the survivor —
    the reliable way to exercise **G10 King + G23 Sandy + the rescue/delivery loop**.

  Both are test aids, not gameplay — leave OFF for normal play. Emitter test:
  ~~`tests/missiongenerator/test_combat_sar_sandy_luadata.py`~~.

## Non-combatant capture race (2026-07-17 night-fly fix)

The first at-scale live run (fresh Scenic Route Merged turn 1: 10 survivors, 12 snatch
parties across 4 races) produced **zero captures** — and the Tacview showed why: **DCS
infantry ballistics resolve the race before the capture clock can.** Both directions:

- The survivor stand-in resolved to a Soldier **M249** (the faction's first human-named
  infantry), which **outranges and outguns the AK snatch teams** — three parties died
  276–677 m into their 1.4 km march while their survivor stood untouched (blue air working
  the same area may have helped; the survivor's SAW didn't need it).
- The two parties that DID close **shot their survivor dead** instead of capturing him —
  DCS ground AI engages an armed enemy soldier on sight, and the kill lands before the
  plugin's capture dwell completes. (The `dead`-state reap handled both correctly — the
  ledger stayed clean — but the POW chain never fired.)

The race is designed to be decided by the **capture dwell** and by **airpower against the
party** ("kill it to save him"), never by small arms. Fix: `setNonCombatant` in the plugin
sets **ROE weapons-hold + alarm-state green** on both sides at spawn —

- every **snatch team** right after `mist.dynAdd` (they want the pilot ALIVE; they march,
  they don't fight — and a Sandy strafing them stays the intended counterplay, they just
  don't shoot back),
- the **survivor group** right after the MOOSE spawn — via the spawn's **real** group name
  (`SPAWN:NewWithAlias` appends `#001`; `Group.getByName(alias)` silently misses, which
  would have no-opped the whole fix on the survivor side).

Enemy **garrison** units near the ejection point still kill evaders (one of tonight's two
deaths was almost certainly the target complex's own garrison, not the snatch team) —
ejecting over the target stays lethal, by design. Pinned in
`tests/lua/test_combatsar_ledger.py::test_survivor_and_snatch_teams_spawn_weapons_hold`
(the sandbox's `Group.getByName` records `setOption` calls per group). Re-fly criteria:
a snatch team walks in under fire without stopping, the survivor never fires, and a
completed dwell yields the "CAPTURED … now a POW" message + a `combat_sar_captures` entry.

## Persistent evaders + the always-run snatch (2026-07-10 squadron call)

A flown jamming test (auto-CSAR **off**, force-capture **on**, a Sandy-only package) found the
snatch race silently dead: the plugin bailed at "no rescue helos/template; skipping" whenever no
rescue asset existed, taking the whole ledger — and the capture → POW → §51 comms-jam chain —
with it. The squadron call reframed the model around the **pilot**, not the rescue asset:

> "When pilots go down they are permanent — they stay until picked up, red races to snatch them,
> and if they survive the turn somebody comes back for them. It incentivizes our blue players not
> to fly deep, because then we can't save them."

Three pieces (calls resolved: capture chance stays 50% / spawn 0.75 NM — the 2026-07-09 tuning,
not a test value; red's follow-up = the **depth-weighted turn-boundary roll**, not a literal red
pickup package (that would be exactly the frozen AI-choreography class, and G21 showed even blue's
own airborne choreography fails); **no death clock** — the roll is the clock):

1. **The ledger always runs.** The emitter always emits the blue `CombatSAR` node (the old
   player-package/auto-spawn early-return is gone) and `addConfig` no longer bails without rescue
   capability — `canRescue` only shapes the MAYDAY ("no rescue assets available. Protect the
   survivor!"). A pilot nobody can come for is MORE capturable, not immune.
2. **Un-resolved survivors persist (MIA).** The plugin mirrors its live ledger into a new state
   global `combat_sar_survivors` ({unit, x, y} per down/boarding survivor); at commit,
   `record_downed_pilots` (`game/fourteenth/downed_pilots.py`) retires rescued/captured entries
   and records the rest on `game.downed_pilots` with the aviator flipped to the new
   **`PilotStatus.MIA`** (off the schedule, like a POW; `repatriate()` returns both). The kill is
   spared in `commit_air_losses` (same pattern as rescue/capture). Next mission the emitter hands
   the ledger back as `persistentSurvivors`; the plugin re-spawns each evader at its position
   (fresh red smoke, an "EVADER" cue, a fresh 50% snatch race, the normal rescue paths — including
   the on-demand AI helo, so "somebody comes back for him" happens by construction). Surfaced on
   the SITREP band ("MIA: Capt Mitchell — evading near Haina (2 turns down)") and the squadron
   roster.
3. **The depth-weighted turn roll.** At every turn boundary (`resolve_downed_pilots` from
   `finish_turn`): an evader whose nearest control point is friendly **walks home** (recovered →
   Active); otherwise capture odds scale with depth behind the lines — 10% within 5 NM of the
   front, linearly to **90% at 40 NM+** (front-less laydowns measure to the nearest friendly CP).
   A capture is the normal POW consequence (`PendingPowRecovery`, holding field resolved, the §51
   comms window, the will drain). **Deliberately no expiry** — a near-front evader can evade for
   many turns; that is the standing rescue mission.

Gated `combat_sar_persistent_pilots` (Campaign Management → HQ Automation, **default ON**). The
gate covers only *creation* of new MIA entries — an existing entry is always emitted/resolved, so
a mid-campaign toggle never strands an evader. **On the rescope:** "capture is a campaign
consequence, not a plannable mission" still stands — the POW raid stays shelved; the evader is a
*survivor* objective the existing player-plannable CSAR package (or the on-demand AI rescue)
already serves, not a new flight type, and red's pressure lives in the turn model, not in new AI
choreography.

No NEW game required (plugin/emitter/turn-model only; old saves get `downed_pilots` on load).

## Pilot recovery surge (2026-07-17 squadron call — "drop everything")

**The finding (flown Scenic Route Merged, Tacview `Tacview-20260717-172716`):** the on-demand
machinery works — 3 parked Khasab UH-60s started in place and flew toward the right
survivors, the clone fallback launched too — and it still rescued nobody, because the
survivors sat 115–370 km from every rescue source. The closest helo ended the mission
3.0 km short after a 37-minute transit; the user's words: "after 1.4 hr the rescue helos
are just getting to the pilots." **Same-mission rescue cannot beat helo transit time on a
big map.** The campaign-scale answer is the next turn, not a faster helo.

**The design:** the turn after a pilot goes MIA, BLUE opens the mission with the recovery
op **already airborne at the evader's position**:

- `plan_pilot_recovery_surge` (`game/retlab/csar_surge.py`) runs from
  `Coalition.plan_missions` **before** `TheaterCommander` — the surge claims its helos,
  Sandys, and escorts first. That ordering *is* the "drop everything".
- The package targets a **`PilotRecoveryZone`** (`game/theater/missiontarget.py`) at the
  evaders' centroid, so `CombatSarFlightPlan`'s hold lands 10 NM friendly-side of the
  *survivor*, not the front centre. The zone offers COMBAT_SAR/SCAR/ESCORT/TARCAP so the
  player can reinforce the package from the ATO dialog.
- Composition: **required Jolly** (1-ship, `preferred_type` = the biggest CSAR-capable helo
  squadron) + optional second Jolly (2+ evaders, capped `SURGE_MAX_HELO_FLIGHTS` 2) +
  optional King (fixed-wing CSAR C-130) + optional 2-ship Sandy (SCAR) + optional A2A
  escort. Optional flights drop silently on a thin wing (the Alpha-Strike `optional`
  mechanism); only the Jolly can scrub the package.
- Built by the engine's own `PackageFulfiller` (ASAP TOT, `ignore_range=True`,
  `purchase_multiplier=0` — never buys airframes), and the **existing `PackageBuilder`
  rule air-starts AI COMBAT_SAR flights**, which is what actually kills the transit time.
  The runtime is unchanged: the combatsar ledger re-spawns the evader
  (`persistentSurvivors`) and dispatches the package helo; the fragged helo suppresses the
  on-demand clone (`autoSpawn`) exactly like a player package.

**The gate (the user's "so it's not every mission"):** once per downed pilot.
`DownedPilot.surge_turn` is stamped when the op plans; a stamped evader never draws
another surge (same-turn re-plans re-plan it — the stamp allows `== game.turn`). A surge
that *couldn't* plan (no helo squadron, fulfiller scrub) does **not** stamp, so the
attempt renews when the wing recovers. A surge that planned and failed to rescue falls
back to the normal paths — player package, auto-CSAR, the walk-home/capture rolls.

Setting: `combat_sar_surge` (default ON, `enabled_when=combat_sar_persistent_pilots` — no
ledger, no evaders, nothing to surge for). The five CSAR settings moved to their own
Campaign Management → **"Combat search & rescue"** section (the HQ-automation section had
hit the 13-field grab-bag cap). Tests: ~~`tests/retlab/test_csar_surge.py`~~ (guards,
gate/stamp semantics incl. pre-field saves, package composition, zone centroid).
In-game pass: checklist **G31**.

## What is deliberately NOT here

- **No POW recovery raid** (2026-07-03, above). If a future squadron call wants it back, it
  needs a fresh design that makes the raid *player-first*, not another AI objective.
- **No red CSAR** (2026-07-01): the generator never emits `dcsRetribution.CombatSAR.red`; the
  plugin's red path is dormant capability only. Do not re-enable without a squadron call.
- **No SOF capture economy** (removed 2026-07-01) and **no armor-hunt SCAR** (deleted
  2026-06-27). The command-post intel fog (`scar_command_post_intel`) survived and lives with
  the recon-fog layer, not here.
- **No new AI choreography.** See freeze, above.

## Checklist map (docs/dev/retlab-ingame-pass-checklist.md)

Verified: G8 (rescue), G11 (scoring), G13 (airframes), G20 (snatch party). Open: G9

pickup/delivery loop still unexercised), G10 (King TACAN radiating + LARS use — partial),
G21 (commandeer preference — partial), G23 (Sandy divert — the ONE re-fly, pass-or-delete),
G29 (persistent evaders + always-run snatch), **G31 (pilot recovery surge — untested)**.
G22 (POW raid) is RETIRED with the raid.

## Superseded documents

The eight earlier CSAR/SCAR notes this document replaced were deleted 2026-08-20, recoverable from git before `5db34150f`. They had each
carried a banner pointing here since 2026-07-03, and the feature they described was
itself deleted on 2026-08-07, so they were two removals out of date.
