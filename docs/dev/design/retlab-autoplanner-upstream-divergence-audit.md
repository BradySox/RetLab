# RetLab auto-planner — upstream divergence audit

**Date:** 2026-08-09 · audit only, no code changed.
**Baseline:** upstream `dev` @ `1a669cac` (the merge base; upstream's 4 newer commits touch no `game/` code, so this equals current upstream).
Diffed all of `game/commander/`, `game/ato/`, doctrine, threat zones, procurement, settings, squadrons, and the aircraft `tasks:` data.
**Related:** `414th-airwar-planner-consolidation-notes.md` (deleted 2026-08-20, recoverable from git before `5db34150f`) · [rebalance rubric](retlab-aircraft-task-rebalance-rubric.md) · fork PR [#820](https://github.com/BradySox/RetLab/pull/820).

## Verdict

- The planner diverges substantially; almost all of it is deliberate and documented (§6 air-defense rework, §46 fuel, §69 SEAD windows, the rubric data, flown-failure fixes).
- 43 ungated changes fire in every default game; 10 setting gates ship ON; 212 of 224 changed aircraft yamls differ in task weights.
- The opt-in features (§17, §52, §44, QRA, minefields, air starts) are clean: parity at defaults.
- Three items look accidental — see **Needs a call** below.
- There is no single revert switch — see **Levers**.

## Ungated — differs in every default game

One line each. Ref = the flown/documented reason where one exists.

**Planning (commander)**
- U1 Front-anchor CPs always BARCAP'd; aggressiveness roll never abandons them, and is seeded per (turn, CP) (§6; Red Tide flew the lone anchor abandoned ~1 turn in 5).
- U2 BARCAP volume threat-weighted: up to +2 rounds at the hottest sector, fleet doubling kept, never below legacy (§6).
- U3 MODERN doctrine `strike_escort_reserve=8`: BARCAP trimmed + non-STRIKE escorts withheld to keep fighters for strike escorts (Marianas: 22-BARCAP/2-offensive ATO became 14/25). **Doctrine data — no setting.**
- U4 `PlanFrontLineCas`: CAS on every contested front, even when winning.
- U5 Common escorts drop SEAD_SWEEP (2 fewer jets per threatened package).
- U6 DEAD escorts: ESCORT + one SEAD flavor + jammer, not all three flavors.
- U7 DEAD reachability gate: a SAM shielded by another live ring is not optimistically cleared; dependent strikes wait.
- U8 Armed Recon fixed 4-ship (was 2–4 roll).
- U9 Strike floor 2-ship (no solo strikers).
- U10 Escort need tested vs fighter *engagement* reach, not the clamped orbit zone (front packages now get escorts).
- U11 TARCAP counts as A2A-escort capability (CAS proposes TARCAP).
- U12 Every AEW&C package is ASAP, paired with a 60 NM lateral spread — simultaneous AWACS, not chained relief. Uncommented.
- U13 Front-less theater: AEW&C anchors nearest the enemy, not farthest (flown: A-50 parked 424 NM out).
- U14 AEW&C squadron pick basing-aware (boat station → boat squadron; flown: E-2s double-tasked, E-3s idle).
- U15 One theater tanker per boom/probe method needed (never fewer than before).
- U16 Theater tankers repositioned post-planning onto actual receiver demand.
- U17 Red-only forward-middle BARCAP screen per active front on large maps (§6).
- U18 CSAR packages (≤2/turn, closest pilot first, never into a live ring) — pre-adoption of upstream #929, convergent.
- U19 §50 map-hidden ambush groups excluded from both planners.

**Scheduling**
- U20/U21 Land BARCAP: overlapping jittered waves; default 15 min overlap makes 2 rounds/CP where upstream plans 1 (0 restores upstream exactly).
- U22 §69: movable AI strikes retimed 2–10 min behind their covering SEAD/DEAD.
- U23 Same-boat recoveries spaced ≥5 min (flown midair 2.7 NM from the boat).
- U24 SEAD TOT −1 → −3 min. Under-documented.
- U25 Patrol legs cost `patrol_duration` in schedule sums (ETAs no longer collapse early).
- U26 Push time walks the real route incl. a pre-vul tanker stop.
- U27 §46 receiver dwell (`4×size+1` min) charged when departing a tanker — #820 exempts AI.
- U28 auto-ASAP checked before the DCA branch (enables U12).

**Routing / geometry**
- U29 Support orbits front-anchored, FLOT-parallel; AI sits 2.5× the buffer back, player 1× (§6; flown pathologies both directions).
- U30 Multi-orbit lateral spread (AWACS 60 NM same-target; tankers 40 NM coalition-wide).
- U31 Tanker tasking fuel-driven: pre-vul/post-vul/both/none per leg-costed route — replaces upstream's every-flight-tanks; pre-vul refuel is a waypoint class upstream never emits (§46).
- U32 §46 tank fitting before the tanker decision (`auto_range_fuel_tanks`, ON).
- U33 Package-tanker window skips tankers + incompatible receivers, opens early for pre-vul (also fixes an upstream `for self.flight` rebinding bug).
- U34 Racetrack laps charged to fuel (a CAP's on-station burn was missing everywhere).
- U35 Tanker fallback patrol speed from preferred altitude, not flat 400 kt.
- U36 CAP band no longer collapses/negative when the defended point is inside the threat zone (upstream bug).
- U37 BARCAP orbit biased up to 75% forward in the band by threat (0 threat = upstream).
- U38 DEAD/SEAD get per-unit TARGET_POINTs at default EXACT intel (APPROXIMATE = one fuzzed area point; no value reproduces upstream).
- U39 SEAD loiter: bounded `SEAD_LOITER` orbit (20 min cap or package-mate-gated); standoff 0.8× for everyone — non-ARM was 1.1×. Quiet default shift.
- U40 Armed Recon steerpoint pushed ≥5 NM off the garrison center (the #406 road sweep was tried and reverted).
- U41 Helo transit 500 ft AGL, was 200 (Red Tide M1 CFIT pattern).
- U42 10 NM FLOT hazard capsule in the navmesh (3× cost) — transits cross the front, not loiter over it.
- U43 Air assault: any `cabin_size > 0` fixed-wing may paradrop (§76, carve #884 open).

**Data + loadouts**
- 212 yamls rebalanced per the rubric; `Intercept` retired from 123 (2 misses below); `secondary_tasks` on 29 blocks auto-assign only.
- Fork lanes: TARPS 700 on 10 airframes, Escort Jammer on EA-18G/EA-6B, Jamming on the C-130J, CSAR on airlift helos (+code-derived for `cabin_size > 0` helos); heavy bombers stripped of ARMED_RECON.
- F-14B(U): upstream ships a byte-copy of the F-14B block; fork rebalanced it (+10 family bump, SEAD out, TARPS in) and fixed the `Retribution Fighter sweep` payload casing upstream still gets wrong (queued carve).
- Loadouts: ANTISHIP→Strike fallback (upstream flies clean), empty/`<CLEAN>` stations no longer invalidate a preset, Litening date-gated, `(XW)` fits mod-gated.
- Removed upstream surface: Pretense (flight type + planning state) and plannable INTERCEPTION (QRA reserve replaced it).

## Default-ON gates — one click back each

| Setting | Default | Upstream when |
|---|---|---|
| `barcap_overlap_time` | 15 min | 0 |
| `sead_strike_coordination` | ON | off |
| `auto_add_tarps_recon` | ON | off |
| `weather_aware_planning` | ON | off (no-op in clear skies) |
| `max_escort_jammers` | 4 | 0 (needs a Growler/Prowler anyway) |
| `region_priorities` | OFF | off — §93 (2026-08-20): per-CP blue emphasis weighting `_targets_by_range`; identity while off |
| `csar_enabled(_red)` | ON | off (#929 brings it upstream anyway) |
| `adaptive_procurement` | ON | off |
| `auto_range_fuel_tanks` | ON | off (U31 stays either way) |
| `continuous_campaign_clock` | ON | off |
| `target_intel_precision` | EXACT | neither value matches upstream (U38) |

Era doctrine levers (Vietnam pair, COIN) are no-ops outside those campaigns — U3 is the one doctrine-data change that hits ordinary campaigns.

## PR #820

Exempts AI from the U27 dwell. Upstream has no dwell, so #820 moves AI timing *toward* upstream; no conflict with this audit.

## Needs a call

1. `F-14A-95-GR.yaml` missed the F-14 rebalance (still `Intercept: 520`, no TARPS); `F-100D.yaml` is the other Intercept miss.
2. U39: restore 1.1× for non-ARM SEAD, or document 0.8× as intended.
3. U24 (−3 min SEAD) and U12 (all-ASAP AWACS): document or revert.

## DECIDED 2026-08-09 — re-converge to upstream (DM call)

The DM's call, same day as the audit: **default planner behavior returns to upstream.**
"I do not care that it was deliberate then." Scope:

- **Defaults flip to upstream parity** (every default-ON gate ships OFF); one "RetLab
  planner suite" preset re-enables the kept features per campaign.
- **Keep only three groups** (argued and accepted): the 8 failure fixes, the feature
  plumbing (flight-type lanes, CSAR #929, §50 hide, Intercept retirement/QRA), and the
  3 data wrong-role fixes (bombers off Armed Recon, S-3B sea control, payload casing).
- **Everything else in §Ungated reverts to upstream behavior** — including the §6
  geometry/volume suite and §46 fuel-driven tanking, both **reverted outright** (not
  re-gated); rebuildable from git history if ever re-wanted.
- **The 212-file weight rebalance reverts to upstream numbers** except the kept
  wrong-role fixes and the fork-only task lanes; Intercept stays retired.
- **#820 sequencing:** stays valid and mergeable until the §46 revert deletes the
  receiver dwell entirely; then it closes as superseded.

Work orders: **A** defaults flip + preset · **B** small ungated commander reverts ·
**C** §46 revert · **D** §6 geometry revert · **E** data-layer weight restore.
Each lands as its own PR with its fork-behavior tests removed or retargeted.

### 2026-08-17 — U5/U6 return, gated (fresh DM call)

Work order B reverted the one-SEAD-flavour trim (U5/U6) two days after it was built.
A live save re-opened it: a Sinai turn-1 ATO put three suppression flights around two
Harriers attacking a vehicle group and left the EWR DEAD package with none, and the
wing's whole EA-18G squadron was spent that way. The DM re-authorised it the same day
the save was read.

It returns **under the contract, not around it**: new suite gate
`single_sead_escort_flavour`, stock default OFF, so an ungated game still plans
upstream's stacking. The trim also moved from `propose_common_escorts` to
`PackageFulfiller.sead_flavour_satisfied`, which catches `PlanDead`'s extra `SEAD`
flight that the old proposer-side version could not. Fighter escorts are untouched --
`PlanAntiShip` doubles them on purpose.

Landing alongside it, **ungated because they are upstream bugs, not fork behavior**:
the missing `escort_type` on `PlanCas`/`PlanAewc`/`PlanRefueling` (an untagged
proposal is fulfilled as a primary flight, so it is never threat-gated, never
prunable, and scrubs its package when unfillable), `ObjectiveFinder.aewc_land_anchor`
(a 1.1 NM safer rear field cost the only E-3A a 245 NM transit -- the third AEW&C
failure fix, joining U13/U14), and the naval BARCAP handover, which never subtracted
`barcap_overlap_time` the way the land branch does and is a no-op at the stock value
of 0. Heavy bombers also lose the `CAS` lane, extending the kept Armed Recon
wrong-role fix. See in-game-pass rows B52 and B75.

### Amendment 2026-08-17 — U15 reinstated, ungated

**U15 (one theater tanker per boom/probe method needed) is back on by default.** Fresh DM call,
reversing work order B's revert of that one item. Nothing else in the decision above changes.

It came back up because upstream issue #243 asks for exactly this and has been open since 2024;
the fork was carrying the gap deliberately, not by inheritance, which was not obvious from the
code. Re-implemented in a different shape — the constraint is stated on `ProposedFlight` rather
than seeded as extra `refueling_targets` — so it is one package with two tankers, not two
packages. Details in the features doc.

The rest of the ungated reverts stay reverted. This amendment is the authority for U15 only; do
not read it as re-opening §6 or §46.

### Amendment 2026-09-17 — AEW&C station spacing, ungated (replaces U30's AEW&C half)

**Two AEW&C on one station are spaced again, by stepping back from the threat.** Fresh DM
call. **U29 (front anchoring) stays reverted, and U30's sideways spread is NOT restored.**

The DM first asked for the August 60 NM same-target sideways spread back. Reviewed against
the real saves before it shipped, it failed its one remaining job: once the target list
dedupes, the planner never puts two AWACS on one station, so the spread only fires on a
hand-fragged second AWACS -- and there the first, laid out alone and never again, stayed put
while the newcomer moved 30 NM, leaving two 60 NM tracks sharing 30 NM of line. It also
shifted sideways with no threat check (8 of 101 track samples inside red's zone on
`brady.retribution`) and put adjacent tracks on a shared turn point. The DM then chose the
tanker's post-revert pattern instead: each further AWACS on a station steps
`AEWC_ORBIT_SPACING` (20 NM) back from the threat, taking the nearest step clear of
where the AWACS already on that station actually orbit. A first version counted the AWACS
ahead of it in ATO order instead; a second review found that collided whenever an AWACS was
added to an earlier package or one was deleted and another fragged, because plans already
laid out never move -- so the slot is now tested against real positions. JAMMING shares the
builder and never takes part.

**The tanker's own step was fixed alongside.** `TANKER_ORBIT_SPACING` always subtracted,
which is "back" only for a clear anchor; a threatened anchor's orbit sits past the zone edge,
so subtracting walked each extra tanker back toward it (70 → 55 NM on `autosave.retribution`,
now 70 → 85). Both builders call `patrolling.step_back_from_threat`.

**Landing alongside it, ungated because it is a bug, not fork behavior:** the land support
anchor could be a ship. `_support_hosting_anchor` excluded `is_carrier`, which `Lha` never
overrides, and both fallbacks filtered only off-map spawns. On a turn with every blue field
threatened, the "land" AWACS anchored on LHA-1 Tarawa, 3.29 NM from CVN-71. Now land-only
(`is_fleet`); a threatened host is taken only when EVERY land field is threatened, ranked by
how shallow it sits; and a repeated target is never planned twice. That is not U29 --
nothing consults a front line -- so it does not re-open §6. In-game row B131.

This amendment is the authority for AEW&C station spacing and the tanker step direction only.

### Amendment 2026-09-22 — engagement ranges join the suite (DM call)

The 2026-06 bump of `cas_engagement_range_distance` (10 → 15 NM) and
`armed_recon_engagement_range_distance` (5 → 10 NM) was never ruled on by the
re-convergence: neither the Ungated list nor the defaults flip covered it, so every new game
still planned with the wider ranges. Found by the 2026-09-22 settings audit's upstream diff.
Defaults are upstream's 10 / 5 again; the planner suite sets 15 / 10. No campaign preseeded
either field. `test_fresh_settings_are_stock` now covers both.

## Levers, if pulling back (superseded by the decision above; kept for the record)

1. "Stock planner" settings preset (the §28 preset machinery exists): flips the whole default-ON table above in one click. Can't touch the ungated items.
2. Revert MODERN `strike_escort_reserve` 8→0 — the highest-leverage ungated item, pure data.
3. Don't revert the flown-failure fixes (U13/U14, U23, U25, U34, U36, U40, U41) — each is pinned to a measured failure, several upstream-owed.
4. The big systems (§6, §46, rubric data) are the fork's identity — reverting is a product decision; carving them upstream post-freeze is the reviewability answer.
