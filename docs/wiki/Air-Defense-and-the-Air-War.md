# Air defense and the air war

RetLab reworks how a Retribution campaign plans its air war so it behaves like a campaign
rather than a queue of isolated sorties. The auto-planner holds interceptors in reserve, lays
overlapping fighter coverage, refuses to send bombers through a live SAM belt, and keeps mobile
short-range defences off your datalink so you plan SEAD against the sites that matter. This
page explains each piece and how it changes what you see when you build packages.

> **Changed 2026-08-09.** The fork's air-defence *planning geometry* — where CAP, AWACS and
> tankers sit, and how many CAP waves each base gets — was returned to stock Retribution
> behaviour. Threat-weighted coverage, the forward CAP line, the red forward-middle layer and
> front-anchored support orbits are all gone. The sections below describe what the planner does
> now.

For the per-task fragging detail (SEAD vs DEAD, BARCAP timing, escorts), see
[Mission-planning](Mission-planning). Reactive defense — everything on this page — is
planned deterministically and is never reordered by campaign-level effects.

## QRA intercept reserve

Squadrons can hold aircraft back in a **QRA (quick-reaction alert) intercept reserve** for
runtime base defence, instead of having every airframe fragged into the ATO.

- The reserve is **per squadron** (`intercept_reserve`), clamped by owned aircraft and
  available untasked pilots. Aircraft in the reserve are not auto-fragged — they wait on alert.
- At runtime, raids that close on a defended base scramble interceptors via a Moose
  `AI_A2A_DISPATCHER`. Many alert bases each put up a **small** response (a 1-ship / 2-ship mix),
  so a raid draws interceptors from several directions rather than one base launching a big
  formation.
- Defaults are a **base-defence posture**: QRA scrambles only when a raid closes within a set
  radius and interceptors chase a limited distance, so QRA does not screen forward over the
  FLOT. The radii are fixed: a base scrambles for raids within 60 NM, and interceptors chase
  38 NM.

The reserve is edited in the air-wing / squadron dialogs; see
[Squadrons-and-Pilots](Squadrons-and-Pilots). The old ramp-scramble system is retired — QRA
is the only live reactive-A2A path.

## BARCAP coverage

- **Overlapping, jittered waves.** Land-CP BARCAP is scheduled as overlapping waves with a
  jittered first wave, instead of front-loaded back-to-back waves that all arrive at mission
  start (which let attackers simply wait the CAP out). The `barcap_overlap_time` doctrine
  setting controls the overlap; `0` reproduces the stock schedule.
- **Flat volume.** Every defended base gets the same number of waves; a fleet objective gets
  double. Coverage does not scale with how contested a sector is.
- **Which bases are defended** is stock Retribution's rule: a base is defended when an enemy
  airfield sits within the campaign's airbase threat range. A base is not defended merely
  because it anchors the front, and the AI's aggressiveness setting can leave any base —
  including a front anchor — uncovered on a given turn.
- **Strike-escort reserve.** On fighter-poor eras the planner gives up CAP waves so a few
  airframes stay free for the strike escorts planned later in the same run. Only the Vietnam
  doctrine uses this; every other campaign keeps its full CAP volume.

## Support orbits

AWACS and tanker racetracks anchor on the objective they support and stand off from the nearest
enemy threat by the configured buffer (`aewc_threat_buffer_min_distance`,
`tanker_threat_buffer_min_distance`, both Campaign Doctrine settings).

- **You can find them from the cockpit.** Every blue tanker and AEW&C orbit is painted onto the
  generated mission's **F10 map** as a cyan dashed racetrack with a label — callsign, type,
  radio frequency, TACAN — so "where's my gas?" is answered by the F10 map, no DTC and no
  briefing screenshot needed. See
  [The Retribution UI](The-Retribution-UI).

## Long-range carrier ops

*Toggle: **Carrier operations** (`long_range_carrier_ops`, Campaign Management) — default off;
pre-seeded by campaigns that park the boat far out (Operation Enduring Resolve).*

Some campaigns stand the carrier hundreds of miles offshore — the real OEF Arabian-Sea cycle put
the boat ~400+ NM from the fight, which is past the stock planner's range gate, so every carrier
squadron just sat on deck. With this on, the boat joins the war deterministically:

- **One carrier package a turn**, fragged from the boat's own squadrons before the main planner
  runs: a 2-ship **strike** section (aimed at the nearest legal target, preferring ammo caches),
  an **A-6E buddy tanker** holding a real orbit off the boat for launch/recovery gas, and an
  **E-2** on AEW&C station — proper flight plans, shared TOT, forced through the range gate.
- **Everything from the boat tanks from the boat.** Any other carrier flight the commander frags
  in a tanker-less package (SEAD Hornets, escorts) has its refuel point pinned onto the buddy
  A-6's orbit, so the ingress top-off and recovery gas actually exist instead of a phantom
  refuel waypoint 500 NM from any tanker.
- Campaigns pair the toggle with a wider `max_mission_range_planes` so the carrier squadrons are
  assignable to normal tasking at that range at all.

No carrier, no capable jets, or no legal target ⇒ silent no-op. Blue-side only. The shipped
example is the COIN campaign `coin_enduring_resolve`. *(Engine-verified; awaiting its first
flown campaign — checklist P2.)*

## DEAD reachability gate

The planner no longer sends strikers through a SAM belt it only *intends* to clear. When a
strike is shielded behind a radar SAM, the planner schedules a DEAD against that SAM — but it
only treats the SAM as removed (and releases the dependent strike) if the DEAD's **actual
routed flight plan** can reach the site without crossing **another** live radar-SAM ring.

- If the DEAD can't range past the belt, the SAM stays modelled as alive, and the strike that
  depends on it stays **deferred until real battle-damage confirms the kill on a later turn** —
  rather than bombers being tasked into defences that are still up and then turned around by
  threat-reaction ROE without dropping anything.
- A close SAM whose DEAD route is clear is still cleared the same turn, so legitimate
  same-turn SEAD-escort-then-strike sequences are unaffected.

Practically: deep strikes wait for the belt to be genuinely peeled, layer by layer, instead of
flying optimistically into live rings.

## Mobile SAMs hidden from the MFD

Mobile short-range defences are kept **off player datalinks** so the SEAD/DEAD picture shows the
sites worth a deliberate package:

- SHORAD, AAA, and MANPAD units are hidden from the datalink — **including** short-range escorts
  generated *inside* an armour or missile-site group, which would otherwise leak onto the link.
- Standalone radar SAM sites (mobile MERAD/LORAD — SA-6/11, SA-2/3/5/10 and similar) **stay
  visible and targetable**, so you can still plan SEAD/DEAD against them.

When you frag suppression, you're aiming at the radar threats that warrant it, not chasing every
ZSU on the link. Pair this with the **Approximate target area** mode and DEAD/SEAD flights get a
single fuzzed target-area waypoint per mobile SAM rather than a precise steerpoint per
launcher — visual acquisition matters. See [Mission-planning](Mission-planning) for the SEAD/DEAD
task detail.

## Reactive, loitering SEAD

The fork's AI SEAD can **loiter near the target, react to emitters, and break off on a computed
timeline**, instead of making a single inflexible pass and leaving. Combined with reactive radar
shutdown from the IADS engine (below), this means SEAD is best planned as genuine *suppression*
that holds the radar down while DEAD closes the kill — not as a reliable emitter-killer on its
own.

## Auto-planner unpredictability (doctrine knob)

A campaign reads as "scripted" when the enemy hits the same targets in the same order every
turn. An opt-in, per-side doctrine knob varies which **opportunistic** offensive targets the
enemy services first:

- `ownfor_planner_unpredictability` and `opfor_planner_unpredictability` (0–100, **default 0**).
  At 0 the planner is exactly the deterministic strict-priority planner; as the value rises,
  lower-priority opportunistic targets become progressively more likely to be picked first,
  while the top target stays the most likely pick.
- It applies **only** to opportunistic offensive tasking (strike, anti-ship, OCA, BAI, and the
  non-threatening DEAD tiers). **Reactive threat response stays strictly deterministic** — BARCAP
  scheduling, escort sizing, the QRA dispatcher, and SAMs actually threatening a planned target
  are never randomised. Variety never delays a real defensive reaction.

Raise the opfor value if red's offensive target choice feels too repetitive; its air defences
stay just as sharp.

## IADS engine

The runtime integrated air-defence system is what makes enemy SAMs network, hand off tracks, and
shut their radars down reactively — and it's why a HARM is less likely to score an emitter kill
than against a dumb SAM, and why DEAD's bomb/ATGM kill is often the only reliable way to remove a
networked site.

**Skynet is the IADS engine for every campaign**, the same engine upstream runs. The engine and
the advanced comms/power/command-center degradation graph have their own page:
