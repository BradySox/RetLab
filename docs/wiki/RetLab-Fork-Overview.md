# What's Different in RetLab Fork

RetLab is the RetLab's build of DCS Retribution. Everything upstream does
still works; this page maps what the fork adds, with links to the full pages.

If you have never used Retribution, read [Getting Started](Getting-Started) first — this page
assumes you know the turn loop.

The build tracks upstream's `dev` branch plus RetLab feature set and selected upstream fixes.
Windows releases publish automatically to the rolling
[latest build](https://github.com/BradySox/RetLab/releases/tag/latest).

## Recon and intelligence

Upstream shows you the enemy laydown. The fork fogs it.

- Enemy sites can be known without their composition, strength, damage state or threat rings
  being known. Scouting or attacking reveals them; confirmed battle damage can require a
  surviving recon pass.
- Unscouted mobile forces draw a dashed circle offset from their true position instead of an
  exact marker. Fixed infrastructure stays exact.
- [TARPS](Fog-of-War-and-Reconnaissance) is a player task — the F-14 plus the Vietnam-era RF-101B Voodoo
  and RA-5C Vigilante. Recon is automatic on overfly: fly the profile over the target and the
  take is banked as confirmed intelligence. Drones film whatever they overfly regardless of
  their tasking.
- Optional **Approximate target area** mode removes perfect coordinates and offsets steerpoints,
  so visual acquisition and talk-ons matter. Mobile short-range defences are kept off player
  datalinks; larger SAM sites stay visible for deliberate SEAD/DEAD.
- **Reveal fog of war (overview)** in the map layers panel shows ground truth. It is a view
  toggle only — never saved, never changes the campaign, and never leaks into a generated
  mission.

Full detail: [Fog of War and Reconnaissance](Fog-of-War-and-Reconnaissance).

## Squadron missions

- [Combat SAR](Combat-SAR). Recovering a downed aviator spares the pilot; you still lose the
  jet. A helicopter rescue is auto-planned by default, or you fly it yourself, homing on the
  survivor's briefed 260 kHz ADF beacon. Survivors within 1000 m come out on one lift. A pilot
  who comes down within 15 nm of a base needs no flight at all — friendly ground and they walk
  back, enemy ground and they are captured, held until you retake that base. Left too long in
  the field they go missing in action. Red gets rescues too.
- [Electronic Warfare and ISR](Electronic-Warfare-and-ISR) — the **JAMMING** flight type turns
  the C-130J into an EC-130H/RC-130H-style standoff jammer and ELINT platform. The old generic
  fighter-pod jammer is retired.
- **Escort jamming** is flown by the EA-18G Growler and EA-6B Prowler only. The jammer rides the
  package, spoofs radar missiles fired at anything under its bubble, and pulses tracking SAMs to
  weapons-hold. Effect strengthens with proximity.
- Fixed-wing transports fly **Air Assault as a paradrop**. Players run in below 3,000 ft AGL and
  use the CTLD *Unload / Extract Troops* call; AI releases over the drop zone automatically.
- Strike, DEAD and Armed Recon packages can receive an auto-planned TARPS follow-up.

## The air war

- Squadrons hold aircraft in a **QRA intercept reserve** for base defence. Part of it can be
  player-manned as cold alert.
- **BARCAP** uses overlapping, jittered waves so coverage hands off instead of arriving all at
  once at mission start.
- **AWACS and tanker** racetracks are drawn on the generated mission's F10 map with callsign,
  frequency and TACAN.
- Native DCS **data cartridges** auto-load in Hornets, Vipers and CJS Super Hornets: comms
  matching the kneeboard, route with push times, boat recovery aids, and the recon-confirmed SAM
  picture. A per-flight DTC tab controls it.
- **Strike packages are timed behind the SEAD** servicing their target instead of arriving
  early.
- **SAM batteries field two guidance radars**, so one HARM no longer kills a site.
- Optional per-side **auto-planner unpredictability** varies which offensive targets the enemy
  services first.
- Enemy air defences run on **Skynet-IADS**, the same engine as upstream, with two fork
  additions: a C2 node you destroyed stays destroyed on later turns, and a ground-starting
  AWACS joins the net once it is airborne.

## Campaign systems

- Campaigns can author [custom victory conditions](Custom-Campaigns) — capture these bases,
  destroy these targets, hold this much territory, break the enemy air arm — shown live on the
  status ribbon and the SITREP, instead of grinding the map flat.
- Campaigns can schedule **squadron arrivals**: new airframes land on announced turns, so the
  wing you start with is not the wing you end with.
- **SP Pilot Mode** gives solo players an express lane — accept the debrief, pick an aircraft
  from the whole wing, take one seat in a sortie the war decided. The map and planner are
  untouched.
- Destroying enemy **command posts** degrades its target selection and thins its offensive
  tempo.
- **GPS jamming** sites deny satellite guidance over an area — a JDAM released inside lands off
  the aimpoint until you kill the jammer.
- Warships fire **cruise missile raids** from finite magazines that never rearm, and anti-ship
  magazines carry across turns.
- The shipped flavours: the [Vietnam campaign layer](Vietnam-Ops) (ambush MiGs, Alpha
  Strikes, era planner ranges, a red tempo tied to the campaign clock) and the
  COIN model (an insurgency that regenerates from ammo
  caches, re-infiltrates cleared ground, and hides among the population).
- [Vietnam Ops](Vietnam-Ops) adds the era's mission-level mechanics — Arc Light, flak gauntlet,
  naval gunfire, trail interdiction, Super Gaggle, FAC(A) marking, snake and
  nape. All opt-in, preseeded by the era campaigns.
- **Long-range carrier ops** put a standoff carrier in the war: a deterministic package (strike
  + buddy tanker + E-2) off the boat's own squadrons, with carrier flights routed to tank from
  the boat's own tanker.

> Removed 2026-07-21: the inferred campaign-phase arc, the ROE zone layer, and the
> political-will economy. Campaigns authoring `phases:`, `restricted_zones:`,
> `free_fire_zones:` or `will:` are ignored, not honoured.

## The generated mission

- [Troops In Contact](Troops-In-Contact) produces prolonged, formation-aware frontline firefights
  with ambient suppressive fire. Formations are distributed along the line, not piled on a spot.
- Supply convoys run both sides' road networks, and friendly routes sometimes hide ambush teams.
- Sea shipments sail as convoys of cargo ships past coastal anti-ship batteries that actually
  engage.
- Ship groups generate as mixed task groups rather than copies of one hull.
- Missile batteries generate with a support park in the faction's own kit.
- Carrier comms match the hull, Navy jets wear sequential squadron modexes, and the deck carries
  dressing placed clear of every spot and catapult.
- Civilian traffic and the RetLab-tuned Splash Damage 3 build.

## Planning and debriefing

- Ground targets have an **intel panel**: known strength, mission suitability, ranges, IADS
  membership, visibility, capture and purchase state.
- Package and flight dialogs show task, TOT, player slots, departure bases, squadron fit and
  target distance in one place.
- The [unified map layers panel](The-Retribution-UI) replaces both stock Leaflet controls
  with one grouped, collapsible control, preset views (Default / SEAD / Recon / Clean) and
  remembered choices.
- The [kneeboard deck](Kneeboards) is the stock deck with RetLab content folded in — a BLUF on
  Mission Info, the fuel ladder in the flight plan, a SITREP page, threat cards, and custom
  image import per campaign.
- The Payload tab saves **per-aircraft flight defaults** (fuel, spawn type, aircraft options)
  and can pin a loadout as the default for an airframe and task — see
  [Custom Loadouts](Custom-Loadouts#per-aircraft-flight-defaults-fuel--aircraft-options).
- Debriefing opens with a **Mission Impact** summary — territory, runway damage, losses — before
  the full event detail.

## Content and tools

- **Eight built campaigns**: Red Tide (Germany 1988), 1968 Yankee Station (Vietnam), Operation
  Enduring Resolve (Afghanistan COIN), Red Flag 81-2 (Nevada 1981), Operation Inherent Resolve
  (Iraq 2016), Umm al-Ma'arik (Desert Storm 1991), Second Island Chain (Marianas 2027) and
  Operation Baltic Fury. Briefing packs for several are in the
  Campaigns section of [Home](Home).
- **Mod integration**: CurrentHill Iran (Shahed-136, IRGCN FAC, `[CH] Iran 2020` faction), High
  Digit SAMs Ultimate Compilation, and the optional Expanded F-4E Weapons Pack. All behind
  new-game mod toggles — see [Custom Factions](Custom-Factions).
- The **settings dialog** is reorganised into focused pages with one-click difficulty presets
  (Casual / Normal / Veteran / Ace), a search filter, an "only changed" view, and a dedicated
  RetLab Features page. Existing campaigns migrate automatically.
- Each squadron spawns under its **own DCS nation** with nation-aware pilot names — see
  [Squadrons and Pilots](Squadrons-and-Pilots).

Most campaign-facing systems have their own setting or plugin toggle. **Hidden enemy command
posts** (RetLab Features → Recon, concealment & intel) is on by default for new campaigns —
