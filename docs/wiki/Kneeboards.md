# Kneeboards

RetLab generates the kneeboard deck a pilot actually briefs off in the cockpit. The deck is
**upstream's page set**, with the fork's additions folded into those pages rather than bolted on as
new ones — plus you can **import your own kneeboard images** per campaign.

In DCS, kneeboards are scoped **per airframe**: every pilot flying a given type sees all of that
type's flight decks stacked together. The fork's layout is built around that fact.

## What's in the deck

Pages are generated per client flight, in this order. Only the first two are unconditional — the
rest appear when they have something to say, or when their setting is on.

| # | Page | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Mission Info** | always — the BLUF, flight plan, bullseye, weather |
| 2 | **Support Info** | always — package flights, radios, AWACS/tanker/JTAC, code words, airfields |
| 3 | **SITREP — Turn N** | previous turn had news, and `generate_sitrep_kneeboard` is on |
| 4 | **Notes** | the campaign has notes |
| 5 | **Task page** (e.g. SEAD/Strike Target Info) | the task has one, and it isn't superseded by the recon detail page |
| 6 | **Threat Intel Brief** | `generate_threat_intel_kneeboard` **(default ON)** and enemy air defenses exist |
| 7 | **Recon** overview / detail / airfield-departure | `generate_target_recon_kneeboard` |
| 8 | **Friendly Packages** + targets map | `generate_all_packages_kneeboard` |

A **flight index** is prepended when 2+ client flights share the airframe — see below.

### Mission Info — the BLUF

The lead page opens with a **BLUF** block that answers "what am I doing and what will kill me"
before the flight plan:

- **THREATS AIR / SAM** — compact one-line summaries of what is up and what is emitting.
- **LOADOUT** — a one-line summary of what you are actually carrying.
- **SAR** — the if-down drill, written to match the real Combat SAR model: evade toward friendly
  lines, capture risk climbs the deeper you went down, rescue tracks your last known position.

The flight plan below it carries a **Fuel** column — planned fuel remaining at each steerpoint —
and a one-line **RTB margin** call-out, amber when the margin goes negative. That margin is the
unrefuelled figure: a tanker on the route never raises it, and the same rule sets the Bingo number
and the Payload tab's fuel plan, so the three agree. When the sortie only gets home with the
planned tanker pass, a second amber line says so and gives the with-tanker figure. A patrol flight also
gets an **on-station endurance** line ("On station 45 min planned; fuel supports ~50 min before
bingo"), because the planned dwell is doctrine and the gas is the real answer.

Each leg's speed prints twice: **GS** (ground speed, knots or km/h by airframe) and **M** (the same
speed as a Mach number at that row's altitude, still air). Reference steerpoints (divert, bullseye)
print no Time/GS/Mach — a chained ETA past the landing point is noise, not information.

*A real generated Mission Info page (Baltic Fury, an F/A-18F on OCA/Runway). The BLUF answers the
brief before the flight plan starts; the plan's right-hand **Fuel** column and the **RTB margin**
line below it are the retired Fuel Ladder page, folded in where you actually read it.*

### Support Info — comms and the code words

Package flights, the radio ladder, AWACS/tanker/JTAC, and the departure/arrival airfield rows. The
colour-keyed **code words** block rides here.

The top row of that table is **your own flight on its intra-flight channel** — the people directly
flying with you — which is why it reads **`Flight`** rather than a callsign, and why it sits on a
different channel (COMM1) from the rest of the package (COMM2). Give the flight a **custom name**
in the ATO and that name replaces `Flight` here.

![The Support Info kneeboard page: the package's flights with callsigns, tasks, types and radio channels, a colour-keyed code-words block, then AEW&C and tanker tables with frequencies, TACAN and time on station](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BradySox/RetLab/main/docs/wiki/img/kneeboard-support-info.png)

*The same flight's Support Info page. Every other flight in the package with its channel, the
code words colour-keyed (blue push, green success, red abort — "(you)" marks your own call), then
the AEW&C and tanker ladders with TACAN and time on station.*

### The threat cards

The enemy air-defense dossier: one card per system with guidance, band, range and ceiling,
**recon-fog aware** — you get cards for what you have actually scouted, not the ground truth. This
is on by default and is the single most useful page in the deck for a SEAD or strike crew.

### Shared-airframe flight index

DCS stacks every deck for an airframe together, so a four-flight Hornet mission is a wall of pages.
When 2+ client flights share a type, the generator keeps each flight's pages in a contiguous,
callsign-sorted block and prepends a one-page **index** — callsign, task, start page — so you can
find yours. A lone flight skips it.

### Layout

Sparse pages (Combat SAR, Support Info, Mission Info) use a light heading + underline-rule layout
that fills the page instead of boxing content into a corner, and long friendly-package lists flow
into two columns. Tables measure their rendered width and word-wrap the widest column rather than
running off the right edge. A theme-aware four-colour scheme — blue nav/comms, amber threats/fuel,
green success, red abort — runs across the pages that use it.

## Campaign SITREP page

After a turn is resolved, the next mission's deck carries a **"SITREP — Turn N"** page: a cockpit
intel brief of what happened last turn — per-side losses, base captures, Combat SAR rescues, MIA
evaders and POWs. Enemy losses are framed as **"claimed"** to respect the recon-fog model (you
don't get perfect BDA for free). It is absent on turn 1, on a quiet turn, or when the toggle is
off.

It sits on **its own page** rather than at the bottom of Mission Info: a busy turn's POW/MIA list
clipped at the page edge (found on a flown deck, 2026-07-19).

## Custom kneeboard import

You can add your own kneeboard pages per campaign — a squadron SPINS card, a target photo, a comms
ladder, anything:

1. Open the **Kneeboards** toolbar action (`QCustomKneeboardsWindow`).
2. Import an image once. It's stored **in the campaign save** (name + PNG + optional airframe), so it
   travels with the campaign and never leaks across campaigns the way the global `Kneeboards/` folder
   does.
3. At generation it's injected into **every client flight** (or just one airframe, if you scoped it).

Old saves migrate automatically (no custom kneeboards until you add them).

## Settings reference

All five live on the **Kneeboards** settings page.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_threat_intel_kneeboard` | **ON** | The enemy air-defense dossier page (recon-fog aware) |
| `generate_sitrep_kneeboard` | **ON** | The previous-turn SITREP page |
| `generate_target_recon_kneeboard` | OFF | Recon overview / detail / airfield-departure pages |
| `generate_all_packages_kneeboard` | OFF | Friendly-packages list + targets map |
| `generate_dark_kneeboard` | OFF | Dark theme, for night flying |
| Custom kneeboards | — | *Kneeboards* toolbar action — per-campaign images injected into client flights |

## Not in the deck

The cover page, compact deck and Brief Sheet were removed in the 2026-07-13 pass.
The deck opens on Mission Info; there is no cover page, no compact 3-4 page mode, and no separate
Brief Sheet or brevity card. Fuel is the **Fuel** column on the flight plan plus its RTB margin
call-out, not its own page. Code words live on Support Info.
