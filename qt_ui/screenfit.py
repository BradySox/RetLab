"""Keep windows inside the screen they open on.

Qt sizes a dialog to its layout's ``sizeHint`` with no upper bound, so a dialog
whose content is taller than the display opens with its title bar above the top
of the screen and its lower controls below the bottom. Nothing in the app was
screen-aware except the main window and the settings dialog, which had grown its
own ad-hoc clamp; the other ~30 dialogs could open at any size their content
asked for. The Edit Flight dialog asks for ~1115 logical px (its tab widget
sizes to the tallest *hidden* tab), which does not fit a 1440p panel at 150%
scaling.

``ScreenFitFilter`` is installed once on the ``QApplication`` and fits every
dialog as it is shown, so this needs no per-dialog wiring and is a no-op for the
dialogs that already fit.

The geometry itself is a pure function (:func:`fitted_geometry`) so it can be
unit-tested without a display.
