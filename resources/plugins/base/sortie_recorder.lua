-- Vanilla DCS only. Tacview is a paid third-party program, so nothing here may
-- depend on it or its .acmi export.
--
-- Constraints learned the hard way:
--  * Records are keyed by UNIT, never by group. group:getUnits() returns only
--    the living units, so a fixed index is not a fixed aircraft -- keying by
--    group and sampling units[1] teleported the track onto a wingman the moment
--    the lead died, and counted the jump as distance flown.
--  * Every human-crewed slot is sampled; AI groups only sample one anchor jet.
--    Four humans in one group do not fly the same track. Sixty AI in formation
--    do, so paying per-unit for them buys nothing.
--  * The track is emitted ONLY in the final write. state.json is rewritten every
--    15 s -- 480 times over a two-hour mission -- and a 60v60 track set is ~1 MB,
--    so including it in every write means half a gigabyte of json:encode on the
--    sim thread of a mission that already has no frames spare.
--  * Every entry point is wrapped by the caller in pcall. A recorder fault must
--    never take down the loss reporting that shares this file.
