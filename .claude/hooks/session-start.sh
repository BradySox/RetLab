# --- the fly cards ----------------------------------------------------------
# Two standing cards, same format, parsed by one function so they can never
# drift apart: WATCH (closes from ordinary flying) and LOCAL (needs a contrived
# condition arranged on purpose). Items are the `### ` headings; the `**Try:**`
# paragraph under one says how to make it happen and is printed with it, because
# 2026-08-06 an item came back unanswered purely because its heading named two
# row IDs and no observable. A Try may wrap across source lines; it is joined and
# ends at the first blank line. An item with no Try still prints its heading.
#
# Only items in a LIVE section are printed. A closed item is moved to a `## Done`
# section (LOCAL) or to ARCHIVE.md (WATCH) — but the old parser read every `### `
# in the file, so LOCAL's two CLOSED items were briefed as live work for two
# days after they were closed. That is the "it doesn't update when something is
# checked off" failure, and it is the same class as the marker bug above: the
# card was crossed off correctly and the reader was told otherwise.
