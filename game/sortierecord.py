"""One record per flight of what the mission actually did.

The campaign historically learned only which units died. Everything else about a
two-hour sortie was discarded, and each feature that needed more cut its own
channel through `state.json` -- there are seven. This is the general form those
should collapse into, so the next feature needing mission facts extends a schema
instead of punching another hole. See
`docs/dev/design/retlab-retribution-long-view.md` seam 1.

Written by `resources/plugins/base/sortie_recorder.lua`, which uses nothing
outside vanilla DCS. Notably NOT Tacview: it is a paid third-party program, so a
feature depending on it would silently do nothing for most players.

Forward compatible by construction. Unknown keys are ignored and a newer
`version` still parses, because the schema only ever gains fields. Anything
malformed degrades to "no data" rather than breaking debrief parsing -- a
mission's results must never be lost to a telemetry bug.
