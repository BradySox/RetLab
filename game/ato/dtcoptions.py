"""Per-flight planner controls for the native DTC cartridge (§74).

Lives in ``game.ato`` because it pickles with the :class:`Flight` (the Edit
Flight dialog writes it, the campaign save carries it, and the next
generation's ``DtcGenerator`` honors it). Deliberately a plain dataclass of
builtins so old saves unpickle trivially (``Flight.__setstate__`` defaults a
missing field to ``DtcOptions()``, which reproduces pre-feature behavior).
