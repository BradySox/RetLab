    leading the package leaves the escorts on their Escort ControlledTask,
    following him home instead of recovering at their own base (test 7,

    Releasing LATE costs an escort that follows the primary home; releasing
    EARLY costs the escort over the target. Every degrade here is therefore
    toward late: with no gate to tell the inbound pass from the outbound one
    (see split_release_gate) the zone is dropped and the backstop stands alone.
