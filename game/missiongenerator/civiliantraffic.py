"""Civilian background air traffic, planned in Python and spawned via pydcs.

This replaces the old MOOSE ``RAT`` plugin (``resources/plugins/civilian_traffic``).
RAT is a heavyweight "living airfield" engine (ATC, respawn scheduler, runway-retry,
heliport-id resolution) and the civilian layer only ever wanted a handful of ambient
flights -- so it switched almost all of RAT off and still inherited RAT's crash
surface (the recurring ``woCharacterHuman`` / GermanyCW-FARP sim crashes came from
RAT resolving an unresolvable *heliport id* and spawning a malformed unit, which is
why the rotary layer had to be disabled entirely).

**Revisited 2026-08-05 and RAT stays retired.** It was reopened as "I think RAT is
the real answer" and closed the other way in the same conversation, for two reasons
worth keeping written down: RAT was never cut on taste (it crashed the sim, above),
and it does not fix what is actually wrong. Pressed on the symptom, the DM named the
two real issues as **civil identity** and **airways vs milk runs** -- RAT addresses
neither (it would not make an An-26 read as an airliner), and its one genuine
differentiator, ATC / living airfield, was explicitly not among the complaints.

So the rebuild stayed here, and fixed those two things:

**1. Civil identity is a data table** -- see ``civilianfleet.py``. The roster used to
be applied globally, so Antonovs and Hips flew over Nevada and the Marianas; worse,
modern civil traffic flew over 1944 Normandy. Fleet, operator names and cruise levels
are now chosen per region.

**2. Airways, not milk runs.** Each civilian used to fly a chain of five short
rear-area legs and land -- a meander that existed ONLY to keep the aircraft airborne
long enough to cover a mission without a respawn loop. Real civil traffic flies
straight, high, and across. Routes are now single long transits at a realistic
flight level, which is cheaper, more realistic, terrain-safe by construction, and
almost certainly fixes the third complaint ("too little / it disappears") on its own:
low-level traffic pottering between rear fields is *invisible* to a player at
altitude, so the felt sparsity was substantially a visibility problem.

**Why the endpoint pool could safely widen.** The old code drew endpoints only from
airfields Retribution does not control, which collapses the pool on maps where the
engine owns everything. For an *overflight* the endpoints are only direction anchors
-- the aircraft air-starts en route at cruise and never touches either one -- so the
neutral pool is now a preference rather than a hard requirement, with any airfield
used as a fallback when too few neutral ones exist to draw a transit.

Traffic remains invisible to AI (never targeted, never affects combat) with
weapon-hold ROE, under the neutral coalition.

**Speeds go to pydcs in km/h** (2026-08-08). Every pydcs speed argument --
``flight_group_inflight``, ``FlyingGroup.add_waypoint``, ``ShipGroup.add_waypoint`` --
is km/h and divides by 3.6 internally to get the m/s DCS stores. This module planned
in m/s and passed the raw number, so a third of the intended speed was written: the
air-started fleet spawned at 65-110 kt at FL200-FL310 and fell out of the sky, the
same failure the QRA scramble hit when Moose air-spawned its jets at ~0 kt
(``resources/plugins/intercept/intercept-config.lua``, SCRAMBLE_SPEED_KT). The
``CRUISE_PROFILE`` table stays in m/s -- it is the honest unit for a cruise level --
and every pydcs call converts with ``mps(...).kph``, which is what the rest of the
generator already does (``knots(12).kph``, ``speed.kph``).

**A transit is anchored at its flight level** (2026-08-08, found while fixing the
above). "Airways, not milk runs" removed the intermediate legs, and nothing replaced
them: a two-field route's ``chain[1:-1]`` is empty, so a ground start was written as
takeoff -> ``land_at`` with no waypoint carrying the cruise altitude at all. DCS flew
the shallow V that implies and the aircraft never climbed to its assigned level --
which defeats the point of choosing per-region flight levels for the ~30% of
fixed-wing traffic that departs from a field. Two-field routes now get synthesised
top-of-climb / top-of-descent waypoints (``CRUISE_ENTRY_FRAC`` / ``CRUISE_EXIT_FRAC``);
air starts are already at cruise and take only the descent point. The rotary layer is
unchanged -- it routes through real fields and always had waypoints.
