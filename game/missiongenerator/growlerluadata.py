"""Growler escort-jamming emitter (dcsRetribution.growler).

The ESCORT_JAMMER planner role puts a dedicated jammer -- the EA-18G Growler or
EA-6B Prowler, the only airframes that declare the ``Escort Jammer`` task (§77)
-- on the package's join->split leg; this emits each such flight and the package
group names it protects, and the ``growler`` plugin drives the scripted jamming
effects at runtime (the Timberwolf/Matador escort-geometry family the C-130 §2
systems descend from): a missile-spoof bubble over the package **plus** offensive
ROE ``WEAPON_HOLD`` pulses on radar SAMs.

ROE only -- the plugin never touches ``enableEmission`` (the IADS engine owns it)
and owns no kills. A player-crewed jammer is emitted with ``isPlayer`` so the
plugin offers the F10 jamming menu instead of the AI auto-policy; an AI jammer
(Growler *or* Prowler -- the plugin is airframe-agnostic, it drives any emitted
group by name + geometry) jams automatically. No ESCORT_JAMMER flight -> no node
-> the plugin no-ops.
