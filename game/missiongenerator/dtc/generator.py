"""DTC cartridge generation pass (§74).

Builds one cartridge **per blue client flight** of a DTC-capable airframe
(FA-18C, F-16C, F-14B(U) and AH-64D BLK.II), binds it to the flight's client units with
``AutoLoad``; pydcs writes the JSON files into the miz on save. Per-flight
rather than per-type because each flight flies its own route -- a package's four Hornet flights get four cartridges, each loading
its own steerpoints while sharing the mission comm plan and SA picture.

Best-effort by design: a failure building one flight's cartridge skips that
flight, and a failure anywhere never blocks the mission save (the caller wraps
the pass; the miz without cartridges is exactly the pre-feature miz).
