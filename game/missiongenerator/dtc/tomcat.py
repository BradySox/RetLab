"""F-14B(U) DTC cartridge builder (§74).

Schema mined from ``CoreMods/aircraft/F14/DTC`` (``F-14BU_DTC.lua`` + its
``.dlg``). Sections emitted:

* ``NAV`` -- plan 1 takes the reference layer only (the front line as map lines;
  bullseye, divert, friendly orbits and known threat sites as additional points).
  Its **waypoint list is not ours to write**: plan 1 is the ME route, which is
  already this flight's miz route, and the editor greys those fields out
  (``updateNAVPlanEditability``). The flown route goes on **plan 2**, which is
  what an authored cartridge does -- see the design note's diff.
* ``JDAM`` -- the flight's target waypoints as pre-planned points on all four
  stations, with the run-in heading and the cached LAR scalars.
* ``TIS`` -- the package's callsigns in the send-to list.

Constraints mined, not guessed, each easy to undo by accident: ``NAV``
elevations are FEET while ``JDAM`` target elevations are METRES; point names cap
at 8 characters and the trailing ``X`` codes (``XB``, ``XD``, ``XHB``, ``XIP``)
are a convention the jet reads, documented in the NAV tab and used by the
authored cartridge; and the jet is the F-14B(U) alone, since
``F14/Entry/F-14B.lua`` sets the capability flag only for that rewrite.

Every section is always written, ``CMDS`` included, because this descriptor
cannot take a partial cartridge: ``setData`` ends with ``init_CMDS()``, which
indexes ``data.CMDS.CMDSProgramSettings`` unconditionally, and a missing section
crashes the whole post-import refresh (ME-proven 2026-08-22). A section the
planner turned off carries the editor's own reset state instead; ``CMDS`` is
ED's stock table verbatim, which is what the editor saves for an untouched
cartridge.
