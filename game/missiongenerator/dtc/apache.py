"""AH-64D BLK.II DTC cartridge builder (§74).

Schema mined from ``CoreMods/aircraft/AH-64D/DTC`` plus an ME-saved cartridge
(2.9.29.27278, the shape audit in the DCS-update design note §3). Sections
emitted, all inside ``NAV.Mission_1``:

* ``Points.WPTHZ`` -- the flight's route as waypoints W01.., named via
  ``note``, ground elevation in ``alt``, map metres in ``x``/``y``.
* ``Routes[1]`` ("ALPHA") -- the route sequence over those waypoints with
  per-leg speed (kts), leg distance and cumulative ETA seconds, the shape the
  editor's own add-point handler writes.
* ``Points.TGT`` -- viewer-fogged enemy SAM sites as target points T01..
  (the TSD has no ring radius; the site name rides ``note``).
* ``Lines`` -- the active front lines (FLOT) as TSD lines.

Partitions the planner computes nothing for (Laser, Radios, Weapon, MISC,
Presets, IDM, ADF, CTRLM, Areas, Zones) are omitted or left empty-but-present
per the sample's skeleton -- the aircraft's own defaults stand, the viper
precedent. ADF stays empty deliberately: the sample's ``Freq`` integers carry
no stated unit, so the CSAR beacon slot (checklist G33) waits on a flown
round-trip before anything writes it.
