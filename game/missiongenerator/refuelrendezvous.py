"""Where a flight's REFUEL waypoint should actually send it.

The planner picks the refuel point purely geometrically -- 75 % of the way from
home to the join point (``RefuelZoneGeometry``) -- and never consults the tankers
that are flying. The tankers are placed by a different rule again: a theater
tanker stations ``tanker_threat_buffer_min_distance`` outside the threat ring of
its own package target. The two have no term in common, so the waypoint routinely
points at empty sky while the tanker orbits somewhere else entirely.

This resolves the waypoint against the tankers that exist in the generated .miz,
at generation time, so the plan and the planner are untouched.

Rationale and the flown evidence live in
``docs/dev/retlab-features.md`` §8.
