#: raid may be from a base and still make that base eligible to scramble for it.

#: Widening the reach does NOT cause a mass launch. Moose's GCI loop
#: (``AI_A2A_DISPATCHER``, Moose.lua) walks every squadron, keeps the one with the
#: shortest *intercept* distance among those inside ``GciRadius``, and only reaches
#: back to a farther squadron once the closer one's alert is spent. So a wide reach
#: buys an echelon -- the front field answers, the rear fields backfill -- and this
#: ceiling is what keeps a genuinely deep-rear field (300 NM back) at home.
QRA_FORWARD_REACH_NM = 200

#: How far *past* the FLOT a front-anchor CP's defended-airspace circle reaches. The
#: circle grows to ``distance(cp, front) + this`` so the contested airspace is always
#: inside the defended zone however far behind the line the anchor sits. This is the
#: only place a side's defended airspace crosses into enemy territory.
FRONT_FORWARD_MARGIN_NM = 25

#: Slack over (reach + engage) for the home-base disengage leash. Moose aborts a
#: defender once ``DistanceFromHomeBase > DisengageRadius`` (default 300 km ~= 162 NM),
#: so without this a base at the far edge of its reach would launch and then turn
#: around mid-transit.
