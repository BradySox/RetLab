"""Vietnam Ops suite -> Lua config bridge (dcsRetribution.VietnamOps).

The Vietnam Ops suite (docs/dev/design/retlab-vietnam-ops-notes.md) adds opt-in
period mechanics that run inside the generated .miz via the ``vietnamops`` plugin.
Following the IADS pattern, Python emits a data table and the Lua side executes the
behavior. Each sub-feature is emitted **only when its Settings toggle is on**, so the
plugin gates purely on data presence (an absent node = feature off).

Features so far:

* **Arc Light** (``vietnam_arc_light``): a heavy-bomber ``STRIKE`` carpets its target area
  at the run-in instead of dropping a single aimpoint (the reframe -- an *effect* of the
  Strike task, not a new FlightType). Tactical strikers are never matched.
* **AAA flak gauntlet** (``vietnam_flak_gauntlet``): an on-marker only -- the runtime
  discovers AAA guns by attribute and barrages opposing aircraft, tightening on predictable
  run-ins. No per-mission threat data is emitted from Python.
* **Naval gunfire support** (``vietnam_naval_gunfire``): emits each naval gun ship + its
  coalition; the runtime offers a player F10 call-for-fire (on the last F10 map marker) and
  an automatic coastal bombardment of in-range enemy ground targets. Coastal campaigns only
  (inland missions have no gun ships in range, so it no-ops).

* **FAC(A) marking** (``vietnam_fac_marking``): an on-marker only -- the runtime discovers
  airborne friendly OV-10 Broncos by DCS unit type and marks the nearest opposing ground with
  white-phosphorus smoke on a cadence (the iconic Vietnam forward air controller). No
  per-mission data is emitted from Python.
* **Snake and nape** (``vietnam_snake_and_nape``): an on-marker only -- the runtime discovers
  attack aircraft (by the DCS "Attack airplanes" attribute) making a low, fast pass over
  opposing ground and lays a napalm swath (a line of fire + a modest bite) across the target,
  modelling the iconic low-level napalm CAS delivery. Symmetric; no per-mission data from Python.

**Convoy interdiction** (``vietnam_convoy_interdiction``) is intentionally NOT here: it emits
no Lua node. Rather than spawn a phantom truck column at runtime, it now creates a *real*,
tracked enemy convoy in the force model (``game/retlab/vietnam_convoy.py``, run from
``finish_turn``) so interdicting it costs the opfor real reinforcements and the loss is
recorded natively. See §35.
