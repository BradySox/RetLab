"""Vietnam Ops Super Gaggle -> real squadron airframes + tracked losses (§37).

The Khe Sanh "Super Gaggle" runs a formation of transport helos (with a fast-mover
AAA-suppression flight) into a cut-off forward outpost. v1 spawned those helos and
suppressors as **phantom** units at runtime (``coalition.addGroup`` in the ``vietnamops``
plugin) on an unbounded respawn loop -- free BLUE airframes the campaign never accounted
for, whose loss was never a real loss.

This module wires the gaggle into the force model without needing the (blocked) auto-plannable
CTLD cargo run. The approach ("debit a squadron + track losses"):

* **Plan once per turn** (``plan_super_gaggle`` from ``finish_turn``): pick the besieged
  outpost + launch field (as before), pick a **real BLUE helicopter squadron** to fly the
  gaggle and a **real BLUE attack squadron** for the suppressors, and record a
  :class:`SuperGaggleCommitment` (which squadrons, the exact per-airframe unit names the plugin
  will spawn, and the geometry). The gaggle uses those squadrons' own aircraft types, so it is
  an authentic detachment of the real force.
* **Emit the commitment** (``_populate_super_gaggle`` reads it): the plugin spawns exactly the
  committed airframes, by name, **once** (the respawn loop is gone -- airframes are now bounded
  to the commitment).
* **Reconcile at debrief** (``reconcile_super_gaggle``): a committed airframe whose name shows up
  in the debrief's killed units is a **real loss** -- the squadron's ``owned_aircraft`` is
  debited and ``destroyed_aircraft`` incremented, exactly like any other airframe lost that
  mission. Survivors cost nothing (a resupply detachment that returns), so no pre-debit/return
  bookkeeping is needed.

**Losses-only accounting -- no delivery credit (2026-07-07 design call).** There is
deliberately *no* garrison-strength boost for a "delivered" run. The only thing the debrief
carries is which committed airframes died, and an airframe's *absence* from the kill list means
"survived and delivered" OR "never spawned at all" (e.g. the player ended the mission before the
plugin's launch delay elapsed) -- indistinguishable without a runtime "delivered" signal the
plugin does not emit, and emitting one would need exactly the Lua/debrief-schema change this
module set out to avoid. So a clean run is simply free: the gaggle costs the wing only the
airframes it actually loses.

No base-Lua / debrief-schema changes: the plugin's spawned units already fire the DCS death
events ``dcs_retribution.lua`` records, so their names land in the debrief killed lists (as
untracked ground units, since they are not in the ``UnitMap``) and we match by name. Fully
guarded -- no outpost / no launch / no helo squadron with airframes ⇒ no commitment ⇒ the plugin
no-ops.
