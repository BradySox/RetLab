"""What's New (§92) — the recent player-visible changes, read in the app.

The changelog cannot answer "what changed lately", because it is grouped by area
(``[Campaign]`` / ``[Mission Generation]`` / ``[UI]``) rather than ordered by
date: two changes landing the same afternoon get written 70 lines apart. So the
recent-changes list is its own curated feed, ``resources/whatsnew/``: one small
YAML file per entry, so two pull requests adding an entry never touch the same
file. Entries are ordered by their ``date`` field; same-day entries by file name.

It also carries something the changelog deliberately does not: a ``watch`` line
per entry saying what to look for in the next mission. That is the point of the
window — the fork's features are mostly runtime behaviour that CI cannot
exercise, so knowing what changed is only useful alongside knowing how to see it.
``row`` links the in-game-pass checklist row that owns the verdict.

Nothing here may raise. It backs a toolbar button that is available with no game
loaded, and a malformed data file must cost an empty window, never a crash.
