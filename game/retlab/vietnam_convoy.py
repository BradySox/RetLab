"""Vietnam Ops convoy interdiction -> real, tracked enemy convoys (§35).

The Steel Tiger / Ho Chi Minh Trail interdiction feature used to spawn a *phantom*
truck column at runtime (``coalition.addGroup`` in the ``vietnamops`` plugin). Those
trucks existed only inside the generated ``.miz`` -- Retribution's force model and
debrief never knew about them, so killing the convoy cost the enemy nothing (a "free,
non-existent unit"). This module replaces that with the engine's *real* convoy system.

Retribution already models convoys: ``coalition.transfers.convoys`` carry actual ground
units between control points, spawn as road-moving groups (``ConvoyGenerator``), are
already Armed-Recon / BAI targets (``ObjectiveFinder.convoys``), and their destruction is
recorded (``Debriefing.dead_ground_units`` -> ``enemy_convoy``) so the transferred units
never arrive. So the fix is: don't invent a convoy -- make sure a *real* one is flowing on
the trail.

``ensure_enemy_trail_convoy`` runs once per turn (from ``finish_turn``, after the AI's own
transfer processing). When ``vietnam_convoy_interdiction`` is on and the opfor is running
fewer than its concurrent-convoy budget, it tops that budget up by moving a few of the
opfor's **real** rear-area ground units forward along a road corridor toward the front. The
units are debited from the origin base (``new_transfer`` -> ``commit_losses``), so this is
genuine force planning: interdict the convoy and those reinforcements never reach the line;
let it through and they do.

**More than one convoy, on distinct roads (2026-07-03 rework).** Several campaigns
(Yankee Station / Steel Tiger's full Ho Chi Minh Trail network, Khe Sanh's two rear feeder
roads, Red Flag 81-2's aggressor corridors) author more than one opfor-to-opfor road. The
original version only ever picked the single best corridor, so raising the convoy cap just
stacked extra columns onto the same road. ``_pick_trail_corridor`` now takes an
``exclude_sources`` set, and the driver loop fills its budget by repeatedly picking the best
*remaining* corridor, excluding sources already committed this call -- so each concurrent
convoy actually rides a different road when the campaign's laydown offers one, and falls
back to re-using a road (via a fresh pick next turn) when it doesn't. A campaign with no
opfor-opfor road at all (no ``supply_routes`` linking two enemy control points -- e.g. an
island chain with no roads between bases) still gets nothing, same as before.

**The trail is now externally supplied, not economy-gated (same-day follow-up).** A live
probe across the 4 land Vietnam campaigns found every rear opfor CP's ``Base.armor`` at
**zero** at turn 0 -- it is the coalition's turn-by-turn production/income stock, not a
static garrison, so a fresh campaign's trail was never actually gated by
:data:`MAX_CONVOY_UNITS`; it was gated by how little the rear base had *accumulated* yet.
Every corridor pick now tops its source up to a standing stock before skimming
(:func:`_seed_trail_source`, mirroring the pre-existing COIN ratline design), framed as
external logistics support (matériel from China/the USSR) rather than local production --
which is the Ho Chi Minh Trail's actual historical character. Bounded exactly like the COIN
version: topped to 2x a convoy load, never grown past it.

Fully guarded -- if any precondition is missing (no front, no road corridor, no unit pool to
seed from and nothing already on hand) it is a no-op and the engine's organic convoys still
serve as targets.
