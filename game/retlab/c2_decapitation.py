"""Command-center decapitation -> degraded enemy planning (§52, C2 family Feature A).

The IADS **command center** is a TGO the model already tracks (`category ==
"commandcenter"`, `IadsRole.COMMAND_CENTER`), but its only gameplay was inside
Skynet's runtime SAM-autonomy graph -- nothing coupled it to the campaign's
*planning*. So "bomb the enemy HQ" was a strike checkbox, not a strategic move.

This couples a side's **auto-planner quality to its own command-network health**:
as a coalition's command centers are destroyed, its offensive target selection
gets sloppier -- the effective planner unpredictability (§17) is scaled up in
proportion to how decapitated the C2 network is, so a headless HQ services worse
targets and hits the same things less reliably. Reactive defensive tasking is
untouched (the §17 boundary -- a decapitated enemy still defends itself; it just
plans worse *offense*).

Pure turn-model: no `.miz` change, no Lua, no DCS integration. Symmetric in code
(each side reads its own C2 health), but only a side with an HTN auto-planner is
affected in practice. Gated by ``c2_decapitation_effects`` (default off); a
fully-intact network (or a campaign with no command centers) is a byte-identical
no-op, so the deterministic planner and its tests are preserved.
