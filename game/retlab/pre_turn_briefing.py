"""The pre-turn briefing -- reasons to continue, shown *before* the commitment.

Single-player campaigns die at a reproducible place: the player accepts the
mission results and never plays turn 2. One reason is that **the fork already
computes almost every reason to keep flying and points them the wrong way in
time.** ``Sitrep`` (§29) carries proof that bombing the enemy HQ degraded its
planning, and live victory progress -- and renders all of it on the *next*
mission's kneeboard, i.e. only after the player has already committed to the
turn it was supposed to motivate.

This module is the read-out pointed the right way. It answers **"why fly
tonight"** from state ``finish_turn`` has already produced, and it is
deliberately a *pure view*: it computes nothing the campaign does not already
know, mutates nothing, and has zero planner coupling (the §3 viewer discipline
-- everything here is BLUE's own picture, and the AI never reads it).

The one thing it adds that no existing surface does is **anticipation**: §82's
scheduled arrivals are pulled forward as "what is coming", because the jet you
cannot fly yet is the advert.

Ordering is by urgency, and urgency is deliberate: a consequence the player
personally caused outranks a background statistic. See
``docs/dev/design/retlab-single-player-loop-notes.md``.
