"""Ship-launched cruise missile raids (§63) — planning, magazines, reconciliation.

DCS warships with land-attack cruise missiles (the Burke's Tomahawks, the
CurrentHill Kalibr corvettes) can strike shore targets via a ``FireAtPoint`` task
with the cruise-missile weapon flag, but nothing in Retribution ever tasked them.
This module is the campaign side of §63:

* **Eligibility** — :data:`LACM_SHIP_DCS_IDS`, a curated set of DCS ship types
  that actually carry land-attack cruise missiles (the §41 curated-data pattern;
  DCS/pydcs expose no per-ship weapon taxonomy to derive it from).
* **Magazines** — DCS silently rearms every mission, so without bookkeeping a
  campaign gets a free full salvo every turn. Each LACM ship *group* carries a
  persisted magazine (``game.cruise_missile_magazines``, keyed by the group's
  stable ``TheaterGroup.group_name``), initialised from the hull table on first
  sight and decremented at the turn boundary from what the plugin reports fired
  (:func:`reconcile_cruise_missiles`) — never at planning/generation time, so
  re-generating a mission can never double-debit (the §54 lesson). There is no
  rearm: the magazine is the campaign's missile stock ("60 TLAMs for the war").
* **Auto raids** — :func:`plan_cruise_raids` picks at most one raid per side per
  turn: the launching ship whose best reachable enemy ground object has the
  highest category priority (C2 first, then the war-economy buildings, then
  anything strikeable). Pure function of game state — idempotent across mission
  regenerations. A target is skipped when the straight line to it enters
  the ring of an enemy SAM site with point defense.

The missiles themselves are real DCS weapons from a real, tracked ship TGO:
kills record natively at debrief (no phantom spawns, no debrief-schema change),
Skynet point defense gets to intercept them, and sinking the shooter ends the
raids. Symmetric — red Kalibr ships raid blue the same way.

Gated ``cruise_missile_strikes`` (master: magazines + the plugin's F10
call-for-fire) and ``cruise_missile_auto_raids`` (the planner), both default OFF.
