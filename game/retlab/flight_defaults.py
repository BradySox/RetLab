"""Per-aircraft "save as default" for the flight payload editor (RetLab, §43).

Retribution re-seeds a new flight's cockpit knobs -- internal fuel, aircraft
condition, wear & tear, spawn variant, and any other unit *properties* -- from the
pydcs engine defaults every time a flight is created. A player who always wants
(say) their F/A-18C to spawn hot with 80% fuel therefore has to redo it on every
package. This module gives those knobs the same persistence the payload dropdown
already has: a small JSON store keyed by DCS aircraft id, written from a button in
the payload tab and applied to each freshly-created BLUE flight.

The loadout has its own "Save Payload" mechanism (writes DCS ``UnitPayloads``) and
the player laser code has a campaign-wide setting; this covers the *rest* of that
box -- fuel and the property editor knobs.

Design notes:

* Storage is one JSON file under the Saved Games tree (never the save game, never
  the repo) -- :func:`game.persistency.flight_defaults_path`. It survives across
  campaigns, exactly like the ``UnitPayloads`` files the loadout button writes.
* Each entry is ``{"fuel": <kg>, "properties": {<prop id>: <scalar>}}`` -- plain
  JSON. ``properties`` carries whatever the user set in the property editor
  (condition/wear/spawn/HMD/ripple/...); an untouched knob simply isn't stored and
  falls back to the engine default.
* :func:`apply_flight_defaults` is called from ``Flight.__init__`` for genuinely
  fresh flights (``roster is None``, so it never clobbers a cloned roster's edits)
  on the player (BLUE) coalition only (so it never touches enemy AI). It is fully
  defensive: any failure -- persistency not set up (a headless test), a missing or
  malformed file, an airframe with no saved entry -- is a silent no-op.
