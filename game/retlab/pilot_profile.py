"""Lifetime pilot profiles (§97) — a career that outlives the campaign.

§96 gave every pilot a career, and it lives inside the save. Start a new
campaign and it is gone, because a campaign's pilots are generated with it.
What a person actually wants recorded is their own flying: every mission they
have flown in Retribution, across every campaign, still there next year.

So this is a second destination for the same §91 sortie records, written to
``pilot_profiles.json`` under the Saved Games tree -- outside every save, the
same shape as the §43 flight-defaults store.

Identity is the **DCS player name**, which the recorder now reports per slot.
That needs no setup, and on a host box running a squadron event every pilot who
flew gets their own profile rather than all eight collapsing into one.

Three things this deliberately does not do:

* **No ranks.** A lifetime page is numbers; §96 owns the rank.
* **No AI.** Only slots a human actually occupied are filed.
* **Nothing is ever recomputed.** A profile is an append-only ledger. There is
  no campaign to re-derive it from, so a bad write is permanent -- which is why
  the double-count guard below exists.

Nothing here raises. It runs inside mission-results commit and backs a window
that opens with no campaign loaded.
