"""Ambient supply convoys -- a few real columns on the roads, both sides, every mission.

The standardization pass on the §50 convoy layer (squadron call 2026-07-06: "convoys
present in every miz on both blue and red side ... a few convoys per side, some on the
same route, some on different routes, randomized"). Where the §35 trail top-up is
red-only, Vietnam-framed, and budget-driven, and the old §50 blue top-up existed only to
feed the ambush, this layer is the generic background: every turn each side's convoy flow
is topped up to a small **randomized** target on **randomly chosen DISTINCT** same-side
road corridors -- one column per road, so a side runs at most as many as it has roads and
which roads carry traffic varies turn to turn. The roads simply have traffic now.

(The columns ride *distinct* roads rather than the originally-sketched "repeats allowed,
some share a road" because the convoy map keys transports by ``(origin, destination)`` --
two transfers on one corridor coalesce into a single oversized group that line-spawns into
unauthored positions and deadlocks at mission start, the flown S5 regression. Shared-road
columns were never actually two columns; they were one parked blob.)

Everything is the engine's own convoy machinery (the §35/§37 no-phantom-spawn
discipline): each column is a real ``coalition.transfers`` transfer that spawns as a
road-moving group, is a native Armed Recon / BAI target, and reconciles its losses at
debrief (killed units never arrive). The §50 ambush chance rolls over blue's convoys
whatever created them, so ambient blue columns are ambushable like any other; red's
columns are the player's interdiction targets. The §35 Vietnam trail top-up composes: it
runs first and counts toward the ambient target, so a Vietnam campaign's trail war is
unchanged and ambience only adds columns where the budget still has room.

**Skim-only -- no free unit seeding (2026-07-07 design call).** Ambient columns
**relocate units that already exist** in a rear base; they do *not* commission free ones.
The §35 Vietnam trail keeps its documented external-supply seeding (matériel from
China/the USSR -- red-only, Vietnam-gated, its historical character), but generalizing
that free-seed to every campaign on both sides would inject un-budgeted reinforcements
into both armies every turn -- a firehose the squadron asked for *traffic*, not for. So a
rear base too thin to skim simply yields no column this turn: the roads carry traffic
wherever the economy supports it and stay quiet where it doesn't, and the engine's organic
convoys still serve.

Runs once per turn from ``Game.finish_turn`` (after the §35 top-up, before the §50 ambush
seeding). Gated by ``ambient_supply_convoys`` (default ON -- the §49 kill-switch
precedent). Fully guarded: a side with no same-side road corridor (island maps, all-red
graphs) is a silent no-op, and the engine's organic convoys still serve.
