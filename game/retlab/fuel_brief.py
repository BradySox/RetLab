"""The in-app fuel-plan readout, for the Edit-flight Payload tab.

Nothing here decides anything. §46's fuel-first planner -- which fitted tanks and
tasked tankers from route fuel -- was REVERTED 2026-08-09; tanker tasking is
upstream's again and nothing fits tanks. Its external-fuel accounting helpers
survive, and this module uses them to *report* the sortie's fuel picture: what
the jet carries, what the plan burns, and whether it gets home.

One fuel model everywhere: the walk uses the flight plan's own
``fuel_consumption_between_points`` (real per-leg climb/combat/cruise rates, the
same call the kneeboard ladder makes) over the planned waypoints, topping back up
to a full load at each REFUEL waypoint, and stops at the landing point (the
trailing divert/bullseye reference waypoints are not flown legs). External fuel
counts the tanks on the loadout being shown, matching the tanker decision.
