"""Pilot career logbook (§96) — ranks and the career view.

Retribution already knew who a pilot was, whether they were alive, and how many
times the ATO had put them in a seat. It never knew what any of them had *done*:
`PilotRecord` was one integer. §91 records what every aircraft did in a mission
and then throws it away at end of turn.

This module is the ledger between the two. It owns nothing about a mission —
`fold_sortie_records` is called once when results are committed, and everything
here is a pure read over the accumulated record.

Ranks are data (`resources/pilot_career.yaml`), not code, because the fork
ships campaigns spanning many air forces and seventy years. A ladder hard-coded
to one service would be wrong for most of them.

Records, never rewards. Nothing here unlocks an aircraft, changes availability,
or gates a mission. The career is a read-out of what happened.

Nothing in this module raises. It backs a dialog and a per-turn fold, and a
malformed data file must cost the ranks, never a turn.
