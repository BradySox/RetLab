# field-declaration order, which scattered ~150 settings and left two 30+-item
# "General"/"Gameplay" grab-bag sections. `FIELD_LAYOUT` below is the single
# source of truth for how settings are grouped *and ordered* in the UI:
# field name -> (page, section). Page order = first appearance of a page here;
# section order = first appearance of a section within a page; field order =
# order here. Re-laying-out the UI is editing this table only — no field
# declaration moves, no behaviour change (field names/values/defaults are
# untouched). Any user field NOT listed here falls back to its own
# page=/section= metadata, so nothing is ever dropped.
#
# The legacy per-field page=/section= kwargs on the declarations are retained as
# that fallback; FIELD_LAYOUT overrides them for display.

# The dialog shows a section's basic options and folds the rest behind a "Show N
# advanced options" link. The rule is deliberately mechanical rather than 213
# hand-made judgment calls, so it can be read and argued with in one sitting:
#
#     advanced  ==  a numeric tuning knob (int / float / duration)
#
# A number answers "how much" about a behaviour you have already chosen, which is
# the definition of a knob you reach for second. Booleans and choices stay basic:
# they answer "which" or "whether", and those are the decisions that shape a
# campaign.
#
# Two exceptions to the rule, both explicit below: numbers that ARE the decision
# (the difficulty economy/skill dials the preset bar drives, so the preset and the
# page can never disagree about what matters), and a short list of expert booleans
# that fail the spirit of the rule.
#
# `advanced=True` on an individual declaration also works and wins; prefer it for
# a new field whose home is obvious, and this table for bulk classification.
