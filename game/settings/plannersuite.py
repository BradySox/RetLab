# RetLab planner-suite gates and their two states. Since the 2026-08-09
# re-convergence decision (see docs/dev/design/
# retlab-autoplanner-upstream-divergence-audit.md, DECIDED block) the Settings
# defaults are the STOCK values -- a new game plans like upstream -- and this
# preset is the one-click opt back into the RetLab planner features per campaign.
#
# CSAR is deliberately absent: it is upstream dcs-retribution#929's own design
# and ships with #929's defaults either way. Route-aware fuel tanks (§46) left
# the suite when work order C reverted the feature outright -- there is no gate
# to flip any more.
#
#: The settings page the one-click bar is prepended to. It lives beside the values
#: rather than in the dialog because a page name nothing resolves to renders no bar
#: at all, silently -- which is how this one shipped invisible. Pinned by a test.
