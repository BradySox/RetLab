"""Bordering-nation airspace (§98).

A campaign yaml lists the countries that border the war, each with a border
polygon, though in practice every shipped border comes from the terrain files
that ``tools/build_terrain_borders.py`` generates. **Every
bordering nation should be represented** (DM call, 2026-08-24): drawing only the
dangerous ones tells the player where not to go but never where they *may* go,
which reads as "the rest of the map is unmodelled" rather than "this one is
fine".

**Alignment is derived, not authored** (DM call, 2026-08-24): *a nation hosting
a RED or BLUE airfield is aligned with that team; a nation hosting neither is
the neutral.* The campaign already knows who owns what, so asking the yaml to
repeat it only creates something that can go stale -- and deriving it means a
country flips the turn its field changes hands. ``posture:`` overrides the
derivation for the case base-ownership gets wrong.

The four postures and what each means to a pilot:

* ``neutral`` -- genuinely out of the war: no coalition holds an airfield
  inside it. It defends its airspace -- it stands SAM batteries inside its own
  border from mission start, as many as its size and its war-facing frontier
  call for, hails you on entry, and turns every one of them hostile in place on
  a player who presses. A neutral with no station point at all is drawn and
  toothless, on the map as well as in the mission.
* ``blue`` -- hosts your side's fields. Overflight is allowed; the border is
  drawn and nothing enforces it.
* ``red`` -- hosts the enemy's fields. Not a third party, so it gets no §98
  flight of its own; instead its polygon is handed to **§1's QRA dispatcher as
  a RED accept zone**, so the enemy's existing alert fighters defend it. One
  interception system over that ground, not two.
* ``contested`` -- both sides hold airfields inside it. Neither side's claim is
  the truth about it, so §98 never enforces it and neither side's QRA claims
  it.

**Whether a country lets you through is derived from the same airfields** (DM
call, 2026-08-26): a country you fly from has plainly let you in, one both
sides fly from lets both through, and one you have no presence in has not. The
dated posture table used to answer this and no longer does -- it made consent a
fact about the calendar rather than about the campaign in front of you. It
survives as the source of each country's era-correct airframe, which nothing
else can supply. ``overflight:`` still overrides outright.

Only ``neutral`` zones need an origin, because only they spawn anything. A
nation DCS does not model -- Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Armenia,
Azerbaijan -- borrows a neighbour's units to stand its batteries
(``NeutralBorderGenerator.COUNTRY_STAND_INS``); it is never dropped.

Parsed at campaign load by ``MizCampaignLoader`` and persisted on
``ConflictTheater.neutral_border_zones``; consumed each turn by
``NeutralBorderGenerator`` + ``neutralborderluadata``. The planner never reads
these -- the border is a runtime (Lua) rule only, by design.
