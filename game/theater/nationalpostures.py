"""Dated national postures (§98): where each country stood, toward each bloc.

Reads ``resources/borders/national_postures.yaml`` — 47 countries, both blocs,
244 dated ranges in five buckets. Sources and the reasoning behind every range
are in ``docs/dev/design/retlab-national-postures-notes.md``.

**What it no longer decides: whether you may transit.** That was its original
job and it was dropped on 2026-08-26 (DM call) in favour of deriving consent
from the airbases inside a country's border — see
``NeutralBorderZone.permits``. The table made consent a fact about the calendar
rather than about the campaign in front of you: it reads Sweden and Finland
``closed`` in 1983, while on the Kola map both sides fly combat sorties off
their runways, and it cannot see a base change hands mid-campaign.

The posture data is kept, not deleted, and ``posture_for`` still reads it — it
is 244 researched ranges that took a session to assemble, and the question it
answers ("whose side was this country on, that year") is a real one that a
future feature may want. It just is not the question §98 asks.

An uncovered date, country or bloc is ``closed``: never invent coverage.
