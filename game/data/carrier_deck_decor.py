"""Curated carrier deck decoration layouts (§72).

Deck-dressing statics for the Nimitz-family carriers, extracted from the
campaign A campaign missions -- the campaign author's deck dressing language,
replayed onto Retribution's carriers: LSO platform crew on the port-aft
sponson, and a "street" of deck equipment (tow tractors, P-25 firefighting
vehicle, Hyster forklift, crane, deck crew) alongside the island, forward of
the angled deck.

One tier, standing the whole mission. There is no launch-phase or
recovery-phase set: the same dressing is correct for both cycles because it
stands where a deck is never spotted (DM call, 2026-08-20). The two phase
tiers that used to exist -- a round-down E-2C struck below before recovery,
and a bow respot spawned in its place -- are gone, along with the runtime
plugin that swapped them.

Every static type here is base-game content: the AS32 gear and carrier
personnel ship in ``CoreMods/tech/USS_Nimitz`` and the CV-59 Hyster forklift in
``CoreMods/aircraft/F14`` -- both distributed with every DCS install, no module
ownership required.

Parking safety is the hard constraint (the whole point of the curation).
Dressing may stand ONLY where parking does not happen -- the off-deck LSO
sponson and the island street, starboard of the angled-deck foul line and
inboard of the six-pack parking row (the campaign A by-the-island offsets
rendered on the foul-line strip and were repositioned forward, flown CVN-71
2026-07-21). Never inside the recovery corridor, and guard-tested clear of
every known spot.

NO static aircraft, anywhere, ever. The first cut parked campaign A's Seahawk
pair + a fixed-wing accent on the starboard-aft spots under the manual's "a
blocked spot is skipped" claim -- and the first flown mission FALSIFIED that
for Retribution's dominant spawn path: LATE-ACTIVATED groups (the §64 TOT-delay
pattern) do NOT skip statics-obstructed spots (a flown CVN-73 late-activated
A-6E pair straight INTO the Seahawk statics, 2026-07-18). Test 11 then showed
the same hazard reaches any hour of the mission: 14 aircraft late-activated
onto the CVN-71 deck between t=2340 and t=3913, so "it only stands once
launches are over" was never a safe exemption. The parked-aircraft look comes
from Retribution's real deck population instead; those positions are kept
below as LEARNED spot anchors.

The known spot anchors below were measured from flown-mission Tacview
recordings (t=0 frame, ship-frame transform) plus a 12 m row-pitch
extrapolation; the guard tests in tests/missiongenerator/test_carrier_deck_
decor.py enforce every rule above against every table entry.

Ship frame convention: x along the keel (positive forward), y athwartships
(positive starboard), angle in degrees relative to the ship's heading -- the
same frame as the DCS mission format's linked-static ``offsets`` table.
